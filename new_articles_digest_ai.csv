The Po River's isotopic composition has been altered by prolonged drought conditions in 2022-2023, with distinct signatures indicating warmer and drier climatic conditions [Isotopic Evidence from the Po River Under Prolonged Drought Conditions (Northern Italy, 2022–2023)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc1b92bd1a6a72cf3112fd32c1a396b4521df720). This study highlights the role of stable isotopes in tracing moisture sources and assessing drought impacts. Meanwhile, a network analysis reveals hubs and hot-spot regions where droughts originate and propagate within the Po River Basin [Network dynamics reveal drought synchronization hubs in the Po River Basin](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/36187212b9913d2894916c5e9923350b93781f3f), providing insights into drought dynamics and societal resilience to climate change.","largest watercourse,watercourse in northern"

[More intense heatwaves under drier conditions: a compound event analysis in the Adige River basin (Eastern Italian Alps)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c71bae8d01666e8b9a8a08e1cacf9615001d759)

The article analyzes the relationship between heatwaves and droughts in the Adige River basin, finding that recent events have been more intense due to climate change. A ranking of compound drought and heatwave events (CDHW) shows that the 2022 event was one of the most severe in the past 15 years, with temperatures 1-4°C hotter than historical analogues. The study also finds that shifts in the timing of CDHW events can significantly influence their consequences, but climate models struggle to accurately predict future changes in these events.

Relevance for hydrology, drought, and climate monitoring: This study highlights the importance of considering compound events like heatwaves and droughts when analyzing environmental impacts, and demonstrates the need for more accurate climate projections to inform decision-making.","Adige River,Adige River basin"

Droughts in the Mediterranean basin significantly impact water availability, with patterns of collective irrigation agencies playing a key role. Research reveals that coupled fluid-flow and heat-transport dynamics are crucial for understanding peak flow estimation, particularly in areas like the river Brembo case where seasonal water scarcity is growing.","Droughts significantly impact,Mediterranean basin,Mediterranean basin patterns,collective irrigation agencies,coupled fluid-flow,filled with water,flow estimation,fluid-flow and heat-transport,growing scarcity,growing water scarcity,including severe droughts,increasing droughts,irrigation purposes,key driver,peak flow,peak flow estimation,plant water,plant water status,produced water,river Brembo case,seasonal water availability,sustainable water distribution,water,water cycle,water for hydropower,water status"

Sediment Assessment Using Coupled RUSLE-SDR Models of Future Mellegue2 Dam in Tunisia,"Sahar Abidi, Hammadi Achour, Fida Mouelhi, Omrana Aıdara, Mahnaz Gümrükçüoğlu Yiğit, Lamia Lajili Ghezal",2025,2025-12-06,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9acd8a32691c28c4a3b186aac695d6d14f198da,"Over the last 60 years, Mellegue1 Dam has lost approximately 80% of its original 268 million cubic meter capacity to siltation, reflecting broader Mediterranean basin patterns in which climate-driven erosion has exacerbated dam sedimentation rates. In response, the strategic building of the upstream Mellegue2 Dam is intended to address water scarcity, improve flood management, and ensure a continuous supply of water for agricultural and domestic purposes. This study fills critical knowledge gaps by integrating climate change projections with sediment modeling in Mediterranean semi-arid environments, developing spatially explicit conservation strategies using combined RUSLE-SDR and SWAT modeling, and evaluating management interventions under future scenarios using drought-flush erosion mechanisms documented across the Mediterranean basin. This study evaluates sediment dynamics in the Mellegue2 Dam watershed from 1993 to 2019 using an integrated RUSLE-IC-SDR modelling approach, with model validation performed using a three-tiered framework that included SWAT comparison, historical sedimentation records, and regional correlation analysis. The model performed well (NSE=0.78, R²=0.82), with an average annual prediction error of 12.3%, similar to verified Mediterranean erosion models. Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations, accounting for parameter variability in R-factor (±15%), K-factor (±20%), and C-factor (±25%), yielded confidence intervals of -18% to +22% for annual forecasts. The temporal study demonstrates drought-flush erosion mechanisms common to Mediterranean climates, with post-drought sediment outputs increasing by 40-60% above normal years, consistent with regional research from Spain, Italy, and Greece. According to the management scenario study, Mellegue2 Dam will lose 50% of its capacity within 24 years if no intervention is implemented. However, comprehensive watershed management based on proven Mediterranean basin conservation practices has the potential to increase operational lifespan to 75 years while also delivering broader environmental benefits. The study finds three priority management zones that require distinct conservation approaches, with the largest return on investment found on northwestern slopes with erosion rates of more than 12 t/ha/year. These findings contribute to better knowledge of climate-driven erosion processes across the Mediterranean and offer management solutions that can be applied to similar semi-arid watersheds.",,"Mediterranean basin patterns, Mediterranean basin",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:54.423577

Traditional methods for studying root systems, such as rhizoboxes and rhizotrons, have provided valuable insights. However, advanced methods such as fabricated ecosystems (EcoFAB) combined with new generation microscopes now enable a more detailed investigation of the rhizosphere, the microenvironment surrounding roots, allowing a deeper understanding of root tissue, exudates, and plant–soil interactions. This microenvironment can be used to investigate the adaptation of plants to environmental stress (salinity, drought, higher temperatures). Our procedure focuses on establishing standardized protocols for plant growth tailored to the EcoFAB system, which offers a controlled environment to study root dynamics. This work also contributes new insights into the early stages of plant germination, an area currently underexplored in the literature. While numerous studies focus on plant growth or genetic aspects, such as gene induction, the germination phase remains underexplored. We have developed optimized germination protocols for multiple plant species, ensuring uniform seedling size and sufficient development for seamless integration into the EcoFAB system. Key features • Optimized the germination protocol for plant rhizosphere studies using the EcoFAB 2.0 system. • Adapted the well-established protocol for Brachypodium distachyon to other species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Fragaria vesca, and Lactuca sativa. • Preliminary measurements of root and leaf traits were taken to determine the best method.",,"facilitating water, water and nutrient",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:53.197384
From HOMED to FORSAID: Sustaining Forest Health Research Across Horizon Projects,"Peter Bozakov, A. Battisti, Andree Cappellari, Davide Nardi, H. Jactel",2025,2025-12-05,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d44e3dfd31ab4b3946223eab34a006ed2fc4279b,"Forests play a key role in achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal due to their multifunctional role. They provide multiple ecosystem services, such as soil formation, nutrient cycling, provisioning of timber, food, and water, climate regulation, and flood control, while also being of central importance for biodiversity conservation (Brockerhoff et al. 2017). However, insect and pathogen pests increasingly threaten forests, alone or after abiotic disturbances such as drought, fire, and storms (Romagnoli et al. 2023). Among pests, invasive alien species are of great concern because they can have a strong impact on forest biodiversity and economy, and many efforts are being made to regulate them in the EU (Ghelardini et al. 2017). In addition, several native pests are expanding their range because of climate change and are called emerging pest species (Jactel et al. 2019; Simler-Williamson et al. 2019). Research is therefore essential to support early detection of emerging and invasive pests, monitor their spread, and inform phytosanitary measures that can prevent or mitigate their impacts.    In this context, the Horizon 2020 project  HOMED  (HOlistic Management of Emerging forest pests and Diseases), coordinated by Hervé Jactel from the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (France), developed a holistic and multi-actor approach to develop tools and methods for the management of emerging native and non-native pests threatening European forests, focusing on all phases of invasion, from prevention to surveillance to eradication and control. The project also broadened the definition of “forest health”, including trees not only in forests, but also in nurseries, urban and rural areas, owing to the key epidemiological role of these components. The major outputs of the project are synthesised in a special issue of the journal NeoBiota, and include a participatory tool for reporting forest damage data (  Silvalert  ), improved multi-funnel traps with generic pheromone attractants (Santoiemma et al. 2024), pioneering studies on pest detection using remote sensing (Nardi et al. 2023), and sustained stakeholder engagement through six targeted policy briefs. Importantly, HOMED underscored the need for interdisciplinary collaboration across forest entomology and pathology, economics, and social sciences, and highlighted the priority of developing innovative tools for the early detection and eradication of pests.      Building on this foundation, the Horizon Europe project FORSAID (FORest Surveillance with Artificial Intelligence and Digital technologies), coordinated by Andrea Battisti from the University of Padova (Italy), continues and expands HOMED's legacy. FORSAID focuses on designing a comprehensive and technologically advanced framework for the early detection and surveillance of EU-regulated forest pests, integrating a wide range of innovative tools, including satellite- and drone-based remote sensing, smart traps with automatic monitoring capacity, robotic devices for rapid insect identification, environmental DNA methods for early pest detection, and citizen science approaches supported by mobile applications. Stakeholder engagement is central to this process, ensuring that research outputs are aligned with end-user needs and can be effectively implemented in practice. The project aims to integrate these methods into a coherent and operational monitoring and assessment system for regulated pests, thereby supporting the development of a novel pan-European strategy for forest pest management. FORSAID also ensures continuity and knowledge transfer from HOMED. For example, data on pest distribution collected in HOMED through  Silvalert  now serves as a baseline for FORSAID remote sensing activities. Generic attractants validated globally in HOMED are being incorporated into next-generation smart traps. Lastly, stakeholder surveys from HOMED provide direct input into FORSAID's research agenda. By maintaining and extending these outputs, FORSAID exemplifies how scientific legacies can be consolidated and advanced across projects.    Together, HOMED and FORSAID demonstrate the value of sustained research, innovation, and cross-disciplinary collaboration in forest health management, and their combined contributions highlight the importance of open data, participatory science, and stakeholder-driven approaches in building robust strategies against emerging forest pests.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:53.197391
Meteorological Analysis of Extreme Fires in Albania during the Period 2019–2025,"Gazmir Çela, Anira Gjoni, Alban Doko, Florinda Kadria, Indrit Rexhepi, O.

The period was selected due to the increased occurrence of fire events and the availability of consistent meteorological and satellite datasets. The analysis was carried out by integrating satellite data from Copernicus (Sentinel-2B), the EFFIS (European Forest Fire Information System) burned-area database, and meteorological observations from the National Meteorological Monitoring System of Albania. The methodology includes the processing of satellite images to identify burned areas, the statistical analysis of key meteorological indicators, and the application of the Fire Weather Index (FWI) to assess national-scale fire risk. For each of the six years, only the warm season (April–September) was analyzed, as this period favors the spread of fires. Spatial and temporal analysis identified the most affected areas, the peak fire periods, and the relationships between meteorological parameters and fire outbreaks.  The results are based on burned-area data obtained from EFFIS. The official shapefiles were processed and aggregated in Excel to calculate annual, monthly, and regional fire statistics. The highest values were recorded during 2024–2025, when burned areas exceeded 47,000–59,000 ha, while the Vlora region accounted for more than 40–47% of the national total. Fire activity consistently peaks in August (52%) and July (35%), coinciding with climatic drought, heat waves, and extreme temperatures. During these months, daily mean temperatures often exceed 35–38 °C, heatwaves last 5–10 days, and rainfall is minimal, creating highly favorable conditions for fire ignition. The interannual comparison confirms that fire dynamics are strongly influenced by thermal anomalies, lack of summer rainfall, and prolonged drought.  The study highlights the essential role of meteorological conditions and climate trends in the development and expansion of forest fires in Albania, along with the importance of early warning systems such as the EFFIS Fire Danger Forecast and national meteorological alerts. The findings support national strategies for fire risk management, territorial planning, and the protection of ecosystems and local communities under ongoing climate change impacts.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T19:15:28.103885
An impact-oriented framework for a deep learning–based composite drought index considering potential economic losses.,"Mostafa Khosh Chehreh, C.

As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, drought is characterized through various indices - meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological- each capturing different aspects of the phenomenon. This diversity has led to growing demand for integrated drought monitoring tools that offer a more holistic understanding of drought conditions. Traditionally, newly developed composite drought indices are assessed through the comparison with existing indices. However, this model-by-model validation approach does not necessarily reflect real-world accuracy or relevance. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed – from comparative validation among indices to impact-oriented evaluation - emphasizing the capacity of drought indices to capture actual societal and environmental consequences. In this study, we propose a novel drought index derived from deep learning, evaluated through an impact-oriented lens using drought-induced economic losses as the primary performance metric. The index is computed using advanced deep learning techniques and a range of drought-related variables. To enhance model accuracy and robustness, we employ different self-supervised learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and variational autoencoders. The analysis utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data (1989–2024) for Italy, integrated with economic loss records from the EM-DAT database. Each model's performance is assessed based on its ability to estimate potential economic losses caused by drought. The proposed framework allows users to select the most suitable index based on a guided analysis, balancing data collection effort and predictive reliability.",,Droughts significantly impact,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:49:16.748743
Parametric Insurance for Drought and Market Impacts Mitigation in the Hydropower Sector,"L. Scarpellini, A. Ficchí, M. Giuliani, G. Characklis, A.

Growing interest has then emerged in financial risk‐hedging tools, especially parametric insurance, to help coping with climatic and market uncertainty. However, the role of multivariate indices and their interaction with different insurance contract types remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we develop a framework to design and evaluate parametric insurance schemes for the hydropower sector. Numerical experiments applied to the Lake Como Basin (Italy) provide a comprehensive evaluation of multiple contracts and indices, while analyzing the viewpoints of both insurers and clients. Results show the importance of explicitly introducing electricity prices into multivariate indices. Moreover, we challenge the perception of insurance design as an adversarial process, by highlighting the importance of collaboration between stakeholders. The most frequently adopted standard contract provides mediocre performance for clients but the highest returns for insurers, while binary contracts require lower capital reserves by insurers. Collar contracts instead are found to be the most cost‐effective option for clients while providing the best risk mitigation, at the expense of higher uncertainties for insurers. For this reason, we propose an additional “hybrid” contract, allowing better performance than the standard and binary, but with lower trade‐offs than the collar. Contract selection emerges as a nontrivial process that requires careful consideration of market and competition dynamics. Ultimately, our results offer guidance to hydropower companies and insurers in the design and evaluation of parametric insurance worldwide.",,water resources,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:03.641138
Topography Controls the Response of Beech Trees to Atmospheric Demand During Soil Moisture Droughts,"M. Verdone, Christian Massari, I. Murgia, C. Cocozza, Ilja van Meerveld, D. Penna",2025,2025-12-01,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb682cc24cc63af49d7cd6752adbfa932bd3bab7,"Droughts can have significant impacts on forest ecosystems. To better understand how droughts affect tree transpiration across catchments, we studied the combined effects of landscape position (topography and related variability in soil moisture) and atmospheric demand (vapour pressure deficit, VPD) on sap flow velocities across a forested hillslope in central Italy. Our results show that sap flow velocities for trees on the upper part of the hillslope decreased during the hottest period in summer but remained relatively stable for the trees in the riparian zone. The variation in the mean daily sap flow velocity for trees on the hillslope was best explained by the variation in soil moisture, while for trees in the riparian zone, it was best explained by variations in VPD and temperature. The analysis of the time lag between daily peak VPD and peak sap flow velocity confirmed that the hillslope trees experienced moderate stress during the period with low water availability. On the contrary, the wet riparian zone limited tree water stress and early stomatal closure in summer. These results highlight the need to account for topography and related hillslope scale differences in soil moisture when analysing the response of forests to droughts and when simulating the effects of soil moisture on transpiration in catchment‐ or landscape‐scale ecohydrological models. However, these results need to be validated for different hillslopes and different tree species.",,"sap flow velocities, sap flow, sap flow velocity, flow velocities",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:54.423706

To mitigate and reduce the devastating effects of these phenomena, finding a common solution that directly involves citizens in the energy transition process is crucial. In this context, the European Union, through the Green Deal, has set the ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and, through the REPowerEU plan, covering at least 42.5% of total energy consumption with renewable energy sources by 2030. The renewable energy communities, introduced by the EU Directive 2018/2001, represent a key tool for achieving these European targets. Renewable energy communities are based on a bottom-up business model as they directly engage citizens and facilitate the expansion of renewable energy generation. Moreover, in several countries, including Italy, economic support schemes have been introduced to incentivize the development of these energy-sharing configurations. This paper analyzes a specific fair revenue distribution model among community members, taking the renewable energy community in Benevento (Southern Italy) province as a case study. The analysis highlights how variations in user types and energy consumption impact individual contributions. This underscores the need for an economic distribution model with a dynamic and flexible structure, allowing adaptation to different configurations. Therefore, the used algorithm should incorporate specific parameters that account for the different operating conditions, such as the presence of third-party producers, prosumers, and high-energy consumers, as well as solidarity-based objectives, such as addressing energy poverty. All these factors are crucial, as the implementation of an inaccurate economic distribution model could favor some users at the expense of others and, at the same time, promote environmentally and energetically unsustainable behaviors.",,climate change,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:56:31.064829

This study introduces a dual-indicator framework combining the Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate (RADR) and the Return on Smart Investment (RoSI) to assess the financial feasibility of SRT deployment. RADR integrates country-specific risk premiums using macroeconomic inputs such as sovereign bond yields, energy price volatility (Eurostat), and green finance accessibility (EU Green Bond data). RoSI captures net financial performance over a 10-year device lifecycle, incorporating installation, operation, and maintenance costs against projected energy savings. The analysis applies this framework to six EU countries—Austria, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands—revealing a clear relationship between national market risk and the investment viability of smart technologies. Devices such as the RVL482 Heating Controller maintain strong RoSI under both standard and risk-adjusted conditions, while others (e.g., ultrasonic heat meters) consistently underperform. High RADR values in Greece and Cyprus correspond to larger RoSI reductions, suggesting potential barriers to private-sector uptake. Conversely, countries with mature green finance ecosystems and stable energy markets exhibit greater technology viability even without subsidies. These findings reinforce the importance of integrating financial readiness indicators into Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) frameworks to inform incentive design, investment prioritization, and policy planning.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:59:20.421913

Methods and technologies to mitigate non-CO2 GHGs are currently limited, which is a reason for agriculture being categorised as a hard-to-abate sector. This study examines mitigation of GHG emissions from manure storage headspace through oxidisation of CH4 emissions at low concentrations, using a thermal catalytic process with and without subsequent CO2 capture and storage (CCS). The technology is studied using a combination of process modelling and life cycle assessment at four CH4 concentrations: 300, 1000, 3000 and 10,000 ppmv. The primary energy demand and net climate effect were evaluated, reaching a net climate effect of +0.10, -0.77, -0.91 and -0.97 g CO2-eq emitted/g CO2 mitigated, respectively. The wide range of results is mainly influenced by the process energy demand being strongly correlated to the CH4 concentration. The sensitivity analysis shows that a net negative climate effect can also be achieved at 300 ppmv with access to low emission energy sources. Coupling CCS worsens the net climate effect of the system at all studied CH4 concentrations, mainly due to the additional energy demand for CO2 separation.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:59:20.421920
More intense heatwaves under drier conditions: a compound event analysis in the Adige River basin (Eastern Italian Alps),"Marc Lemus-Canovas, Alice Crespi, Elena Maines, Stefano Terzi, Massimiliano Pittore",2025,2025-11-28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c71bae8d01666e8b9a8a08e1cacf9615001d759,"Abstract. The Adige River basin has been affected several times in recent years by concurrent very hot and dry conditions. In summers 2015, 2017, and more recently in 2021–2022, severe hydrological droughts compounded and cascaded with wildfire and heatwave events. The chained effect of snow deficit in winter, higher-than-normal temperatures in early spring and heatwaves during summer caused multiple drought impacts. Despite the severe consequences, the role of observed climate change in exacerbating the intensity of the drivers leading to specific hot and dry events and their potential impacts in this region remains poorly understood. A ranking of compound drought and heatwave events (CDHW) occurring in the Adige River basin between 1950 and 2023 was built using E-OBS precipitation and temperature observations. The ranking was based on a composite index considering both event intensity and the spatial extent of the affected area, derived from the Standardised Precipitation Index at a 6 month scale (SPI-6) and a heatwave definition based on daily maximum temperature (TX). The major 2022 CDHW event, which caused severe environmental and societal impacts in the Adige River catchment, stood out. Occurring in late spring (10–28 May 2022), it ranked fifth out of 119 events detected since 1950 and was the most intense CDHW event in the past 15 years. As one of the most recent and severe CDHW events, the 2022 event was selected for an in-depth characterisation and a climate change attribution analysis of both its meteorological drivers and hydrological impacts. The changing characteristics of CDHW events similar to that of May 2022 were investigated through a flow-analogue attribution approach based on the reconstruction of its atmospheric conditions using ERA5 geopotential height at 500 hPa. By comparing May 2022 CDHW flow analogues from 1951–1980 (low anthropogenic forcing) and 1992–2021 (moderate-high anthropogenic forcing), we found that heatwaves comparable to the one in May 2022 are now significantly hotter – by 1–4 °C – than historical analogues and occur in a much drier context, characterised by pronounced precipitation deficits. These conditions, along with earlier snowmelt and persistent precipitation deficits, might have exacerbated river flow reductions and water stress in recent years. Also, shifts in the timing of a CDHW event were found to significantly influence the severity of its potential consequences. However, extracting a reliable signal of future changes in the characteristics of CDHW events from climate projections remains challenging. Based on flow-conditioned analogues of the May 2022 event from 25 EURO-CORDEX simulations, more than half of the models failed to reproduce the observed sign of change in temperature and drought conditions. Unconditioned reconstructions showed closer agreement with observations, particularly for temperature patterns, but critical aspects such as the magnitude of the changes remained underestimated.",,"Adige River basin, Adige River",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:53.197302

Among these, zeolite-rich rocks referred to as zeolitites have emerged as promising materials for pollution control and sustainable agriculture. Zeolitites are naturally occurring crystalline aluminosilicate minerals with high cation-exchange capacity, strong adsorption potential, and exceptional water management properties. Italian chabazite-rich zeolitites, in particular, are rich in potassium (K) and low in sodium (Na), making them especially suitable for agricultural use. Studies have shown that incorporating zeolitites into soil or growing substrates improves nutrient retention, reduces leaching, enhances moisture availability, and decreases dependence on synthetic fertilizers and irrigation. These benefits contribute to improved crop productivity and quality, while enhancing environmental resilience. Despite these advantages, the role of zeolitites under challenging climatic conditions—such as drought or salinity—remains underexplored.

Model performance for the historical period (1951–2005) is evaluated against the Copernicus Emergency Management Service ERA5 reanalysis using correlation, root mean square error, bias, and inter-model variability as validation metrics. Future projections are analyzed using the time of emergence and global temperature of emergence frameworks under two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), to identify when and under which global warming levels fire-conducive conditions emerge beyond natural variability. Results show that FWI and the fine fuel moisture code reproduce observed variability most accurately (r > 0.70), while cumulative indices such as the drought code and Duff moisture code exhibit larger uncertainties linked to precipitation biases and long-term moisture processes. Projections indicate that extreme fire weather conditions (represented by the frequency of days exceeding the 95th percentile of FWI, FWI95d) emerge earliest and most extensively, particularly under the high-emission RCP8.5 scenario, with large areas of northern and central South America crossing emergence thresholds during the early years of the 2030s decade. In contrast, indices related to fire-season length (FWIfwsl) and seasonal severity (FWIfs) show delayed and spatially fragmented emergence patterns, reflecting their stronger dependence on persistent warming trends. A critical finding is that several regions, including southern Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina, and Bolivia, have already exceeded emergence thresholds during the historical period, signaling that shifts in fire-weather regimes are already underway. These results highlight the urgent need to strengthen fire management and adaptation strategies across South America, while emphasizing that limiting global warming below 2 °C would significantly delay and reduce the extent of emerging fire danger in the region.",,"Climate Downscaling Experiment, Regional Climate Downscaling, Coordinated Regional Climate, Experiment regional climate, regional climate models",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T19:11:49.992713

Climate change is increasingly recognized as a threat to mental health, giving rise to constructs such as eco-anxiety and solastalgia. Although these phenomena have gained attention, quantitative data from European populations remain scarce. Objectives. This study investigated the prevalence and correlates of eco-anxiety in an Italian sample, focusing on associations with demographics, environmental disaster exposure, psychological distress, psychosis-risk indicators, and quality of life. Methods. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 1051 participants. Measures included the Hogg Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS-13), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ-16), SF-36 Health Survey, and a socio-demographic/environmental exposure questionnaire. Data were analyzed using correlations, t-tests, and regression analyses. Results. Eco-anxiety was higher among younger participants, women, and individuals without children, while education showed a weak negative association. No differences emerged by rural vs. urban residence. Participants exposed to floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides reported elevated eco-anxiety. Scores correlated strongly with general distress (r = 0.57), positively with psychosis-risk indicators (PQ-16 distress, r = 0.42), and negatively with quality of life (r = −0.25). Conclusions. Eco-anxiety in Italy is linked to socio-demographic vulnerabilities, disaster exposure, and impaired mental health.

To address this gap, this study assessed five widely used satellite precipitation products, CHIRPS, GPM, HSAF, PDIRNOW, and SM2RAIN, against the high-resolution SCIA-ISPRA ground dataset. These products were selected because they represent distinct retrieval approaches (infrared–station hybrid, microwave integration, geostationary blending, neural-network infrared, and soil–moisture inversion) and offer diverse temporal and spatial resolutions suitable for both research and operational monitoring. The evaluation, conducted at daily, seasonal, and annual scales using categorical, continuous, and extreme-event indices, revealed that no single product performs optimally across all metrics. GPM achieved the most balanced and reliable performance overall, whereas PDIRNOW and SM2RAIN provided strong detection but frequent overestimation. CHIRPS yielded conservative estimates with few false alarms, while HSAF was less consistent, especially during winter. The results underscore that product suitability depends on the intended application: detection-oriented systems like PDIRNOW are preferable for flood forecasting, whereas conservative datasets like CHIRPS better support drought monitoring. Overall, integrating multiple products or adopting hybrid approaches is recommended to enhance precipitation assessment accuracy over complex Mediterranean terrains.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:49:16.748791
Comparison of Vegetation Indices from Sentinel-2 on Table Grape Plastic-Covered Vineyards: Utilisation of Spectral Correction and Correlation with Yield,"Giuseppe Roselli, G. Gentilesco, A.

There is increasing evidence of its negative effects on both thermal regimes—potentially leading to accelerated phenology and unbalanced sugar-to-acid ratios—and hydric regimes—causing water stress that impacts berry development and final yield. The use of plastic covering in vineyards is a widespread technique, particularly in regions with high climatic variability such as the Mediterranean Basin (e.g., Southern Italy, Spain, Greece), aimed at protecting both vegetation and grapes from external factors such as hail, heavy rainfall, wind, and extreme solar radiation, which can cause physical damage, promote fungal diseases, and lead to berry sunburn. This study explores the impact of six distinct commercial plastic films, with varying optical properties, on the retrieval and accuracy of vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 imagery in a mid-season table grape vineyard (Autumn Crisp®) in Southern Italy during the 2024 growing season. Laboratory spectroradiometric analyses were conducted to measure film-specific transmittance and reflectance factors from 200 to 1500 nm, enabling the development of a first-order linear spectral correction model applied to Sentinel-2 imagery. Vegetation indices (NDVI, CVI, GNDVI, LWCI) were corrected for plastic interference and analysed through univariate statistics and Principal Component Analysis. Results showed that after applying the spectral correction model, film T2 displayed the higher NDVI value (0.73). Films T3 and T4—characterised by high visible light transmittance (>39%) and low reflectance (<11% in the Red/NIR)—resulted in lower vine vigour and photosynthetic activity, with mean corrected NDVI values equal to 0.70, though still significantly higher than those of films T1 (0.65) and T5 (0.67). Films T6 and T1 were associated with greater water conservation, as indicated by the highest mean LWCI values (T6: 0.59; T1: 0.52), but lower chlorophyll-related signals, evidenced by the lowest mean CVI values (T6: 1.31; T1: 1.74) and GNDVI values (T6: 0.46; T1: 0.48). Among the corrected indices, NDVI demonstrated strong positive correlations with yield (r = 0.900) and total soluble solids per vine (TSS*vine, in kg), a key quality parameter representing the total sugar yield (r = 0.883), supporting its suitability as an index for vine productivity and fruit quality. The proposed correction method significantly improves the reliability of remote sensing in covered vineyards, as demonstrated by the strong correlations between corrected NDVI and yield (R2 = 0.810) and sugar content (R2 = 0.779), relationships that were not analysable with the uncorrected data; may guide film selection—opting for high-transmittance films (e.g., T2, T3) for yield or water-conserving films (e.g., T6) for stress mitigation—and irrigation strategies, such as using the corrected LWCI for precision scheduling.

Between February 2022 and February 2023, the basin was affected by exceptional climatic anomalies, with unprecedented high temperatures, marked precipitation deficits, and the most severe hydrological drought documented in the instrumental record. Po river waters sampled during this period showed variable increases (Na+, K+, Mg2+, HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−) or decreases (Ca2+, NO3−) in the geochemical composition of major ions compared to data from previous decades collected under various climatic and hydrological conditions In contrast, the water stable isotope composition (δ2H and δ18O) of the period 2022–2023 displayed distinct and peculiar signatures, ranging from −64.1 to −53.5‰ for δ2H and from −9.4 to −5.7‰ for δ18O, compared to historical averages for 1998–2014 (−71.3 to −58.0‰ and −10.0 to −8.7‰, respectively). These values indicate a strong enrichment in heavy isotopes, reflecting warmer and drier climatic conditions, comparable only to those observed during the severe drought of 2015. Two groups of data were identified: Group 1, showing affinities with Eastern Mediterranean precipitation, and Group 2, characterized by pronounced evaporative isotopic enrichment due to prolonged drought, as evidenced by strongly negative d-excess and LC-excess values, consistent with those from arid and semi-arid regions worldwide.

This study evaluates supplemental irrigation management strategies adopted by three Reclamation Consortia in the Venetian Plain (Northeast Italy): Piave, Veneto Orientale and Acque Risorgive. The Consortia were selected based on their territorial and structural characteristics, as well as their different approach to managing water resources. This study fills a critical gap by integrating FAO AquaCrop-based estimates of irrigation needs for the 2022 and 2023 irrigation seasons in maize, grapevine and radicchio with an institutional analysis of Reclamation Consortia, offering an innovative framework that links technical and governance aspects of sustainable water management. Results reveal considerable variability among Consortia in terms of organizational structure, technological adoption, and resilience to drought. The 2022 season, characterized by extreme drought, required substantially higher irrigation volumes across all crops and soil types with significant differences compared to 2023 (p < 0.001), particularly for maize and grapevine (73% more irrigation water in maize). Well-drained soils and sprinkler irrigated crops showed the highest water demand (+45 mm compared to drip irrigation, p = 0.058), while loamy soils and drip systems proved more efficient. The Piave Consortium demonstrated the most advanced management system, supported by digital tools and structured rotation schedules. Nevertheless, structural factors, such as geographic location and infrastructure capacity, play a critical role in shaping resilience, leading to higher vulnerability in Consortia like Veneto Orientale and robustness in Acque Risorgive during drought conditions (i.e., 2022). Overall, the findings highlight the need to strengthen the main pillars of adaptation in irrigated agriculture, i.e., technology (decision support systems), governance (inter-Consortium coordination), and infrastructure (storage facilities), to promote flexible irrigation planning, enhance adaptive capacity, and ensure long-term sustainability under changing climatic conditions. These strategies also contribute directly to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 2, 6, and 13 (Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, and Climate Action) by improving water use efficiency, securing crop production, and enhancing resilience to climate change.",,"sustainable water distribution, growing scarcity",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:04.862181

While drought tolerance has been extensively studied during vegetative and reproductive stages, its effects on seed germination remain comparatively underexplored. This is particularly relevant for maize (Zea mays), a globally relevant staple crop whose productivity is highly sensitive to water deficit, making the identification of drought-tolerant varieties a high priority. Addressing this challenge requires sustainable agricultural practices. Plant-based biostimulants (PBs), derived from natural sources, are gaining attention for their ability to promote plant growth, enhance stress resilience, and reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers, thus supporting both bioeconomy and environmental sustainability. Similarly, seed priming, a pre-sowing technique that improves germination efficiency, offers an additional strategy to strengthen crop resilience. In this study, 26 Italian maize genotypes were evaluated for their drought-tolerance potential. Biostimulants produced from plant waste by-products (red chicory and cauliflower extracts) were applied as seed priming agents and the germination performance under drought stress was monitored over a 14 days period. The germination behavior was evaluated by calculating several parameters, including germination percentage, speed, seedling growth, and stress tolerance index. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was quantified in the dry seeds of selected genotypes, alongside the expression of genes involved in ROS homeostasis and drought response. The obtained results reveal genotype-dependent responses to drought and demonstrate that priming treatments enhanced both drought tolerance and germination performance in several maize genotypes. This study emphasizes the value of genetic diversity and highlights the potential of seed priming with plant-based biostimulants as a sustainable strategy within the framework of circular bioeconomy and climate-resilient agriculture.",,"Climate change poses, limited water availability, Climate change",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:49:16.748760

This study evaluates the ability of state-of-the-art seasonal forecast systems from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) to predict summer drought conditions in Europe using the June-July-August Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-3), which shows more spatially coherent and higher forecast skill across the region than the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Leveraging this superior performance, we adopt SPEI-3 as the reference drought indicator. We then implement a systematic multi-metric evaluation framework to benchmark individual systems, their multi-model ensemble (MME) and to identify patterns of predictive skill across regions and lead times. Our findings reveal that when SPEI forecasts are initialized at the onset of the summer season, all models exhibit on average good quality in terms of correlation, accuracy, reliability, and discrimination skills, though with local variability. The performance is better for all models in Southern Europe, indicating higher predictability of SPEI in that region compared to Northern Europe, where summer drought variability is mainly driven by precipitation, which is inherently less predictable than temperature. Results show that, when a general analysis at regional scale is needed, the MME offers the most robust solution, demonstrating more widespread significant skill compared to single models, up to a 1-month lead time. These findings highlight the value of SPEI-based ensemble forecasts for early summer drought detection and provide actionable insights into where and when seasonal predictions offer the greatest utility across Europe.",,"Standardized Precipitation Index, Climate Change Service, Copernicus Climate Change, Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration, Standardized Precipitation",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T19:11:49.992671

This study introduces a methodology that comparatively evaluates the cost–benefit relationship between 11 different SRTs across three European countries—Cyprus, Italy and The Netherlands. Key performance indicators (KPIs) for energy-focused aspects such as Country-Specific Energy Savings Potential (CSESP) and Seasonal Smart Efficiency Coefficient (SSEC) and financial aspects such as Smart Readiness Cost Index (SRCI), Labor Cost Impact Factor (LCIF), Return on Smart Investment (RoSI), and Smart Investment Break-Even Period (SIBEP) were used to quantify the performance of the SRTs. The results indicate that regional labor rates, energy pricing, and climatic conditions—as well as relative technology cost–benefit tradeoffs—play a significant role in the economic viability of smart-ready devices. Having low labor costs and energy pricing, Cyprus exhibited the most cost-effective outcomes among the three countries. Italy showed strong returns although the initial investments were higher. The Netherlands was observed to benefit the most from heating-oriented technologies. The study comes to the conclusion that regionally specific methods are necessary for the adoption of SRTs and that techno-economic performance cannot be assessed separately from local market dynamics. The proposed framework supports stakeholders and policymakers in smart building investment and planning by offering a scalable method for device-level benchmarking. These indicators are developed specifically for this study and are not part of the official EU SRI (Smart Readiness Indicator) methodology. Their inclusion supports device-level evaluation and complements ongoing efforts toward SRI standardization. This research directly addresses Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, as well as SDG 11 on Sustainable Development, by evaluating how smart-ready technologies can contribute to energy efficiency and decarbonization in buildings.

Using a stratified random sampling design approach encompassing different elevations and aspects in non‐native old‐established black pine plantations of the eastern European Alps, we sampled 55 plots over 6200 km  2  in which we collected data on abiotic conditions and species cover for each forest layer (tree, shrub, herb), and forest regeneration (i.e., woody juvenile species). We adopted structural equation models (SEMs) to investigate the causal relationships between multiple environmental conditions and forest layer interactions on alpha and beta plant diversity. Furthermore, we ran redundancy analysis (RDA) to test for the effect of multiple environmental conditions and forest structural parameters on the ecology of the herbaceous communities.          High‐ and low‐elevation sites had reduced alpha diversity likely because of frost and drought climatic constraints. Shaded conditions due to tree canopy cover directly reduced alpha shrub diversity, and indirectly the herb diversity. Beta diversity of each layer was mainly influenced by slope and elevation. The composition of trees set off a cascading effect, shaping shrub communities and, in turn, the herbaceous and juvenile layers below.        Non‐native old‐established plantations close to the native range of black pine showed high diversity coupled with scarce regeneration. Our insights are crucial for understanding the rewilding of old‐established plantation forests.

In this work, we present a SPICE model for a 4H-SiC BJT and TTL inverter exposed to gamma radiation. The devices were fabricated using a dedicated SiC bipolar process at KTH (Sweden) and tested at the 60Co Calliope (Italy) facility up to 800 krad (Si). Experimental data, including Gummel plots and inverter transfer characteristics, were used to calibrate and refine a VBIC-based SPICE model. The adjusted model accounts for both bulk and surface degradation mechanisms by extracting parameters of forward current gain (βF), saturation current (IS), base resistance (RB), and forward transit time (TF). Results show a uniform degradation of BJTs, primarily manifested as reduced current gain and increased base resistance, while the inverter maintained functional operation up to 600 krad(Si). Extrapolation of the SPICE model predicts a failure threshold near 16 Mrad(Si), far exceeding the tolerance of conventional silicon circuits.

However, the impacts of climate change, such as rising temperatures, lower rainfall, and more frequent extreme weather events, are increasing aridity in traditional wine-producing areas. These changes threaten the long-term sustainability of vineyards by reducing grape yield and quality. This study introduces a data-based approach to assess and map water stress in vineyard landscapes, using freely available satellite data from European and American space programs. The method combines several environmental indicators that reflect drought and plant stress, including land surface temperature, changes in vegetation health, rainfall shortages, and soil water availability. These variables are analyzed using a statistical technique that reduces complexity and highlights dominant patterns of stress across space. The approach was applied to the Negramaro wine district in Brindisi, in southern Italy, an area highly exposed to water scarcity. The analysis produced vulnerability maps that identify zones most at risk, supporting precise and adaptive vineyard management strategies. These include optimized irrigation, better canopy management, and soil conservation measures. This method also supports broader planning efforts, such as climate-smart farming policies, remote sensing-based insurance schemes, and environmental subsidy targeting.

Using the presence and numerical abundance data collected in a long‐term survey (2000–24) of breeding colonies of Lesser Kestrel  Falco naumanni  in Sicily (southern Italy), we defined occupancy patterns (on a focal sample of 99 colonies) and estimated population size (on a regional sample of 198 colonies). Each colony was categorized according to covariates based on its landscape (lowland, highland) and location in natural (cliffs) or artificial (buildings) sites. Occupancy modelling highlighted the prevalence of higher, annually variable colonization rates compared with low, annually constant local colony extinction rates. The colonization rates of the natural highland sites have a magnitude equivalent to those of local extinction rates of the artificial lowland sites, implying that local extinction in lowland colonies is compensated by colonization of cliffs in highlands. Furthermore, highland natural sites tend to have higher occupancy rates than colonies located elsewhere on the island. Since 2000, the Sicilian population increased to a peak of 1365 estimated pairs in 2011, then decreased, halving in 2019. From 2020 to 2024, a new numerical growth is taking place, mainly in the highland population. The lowland population is currently limited by the collapse of the buildings in which they nest and by drought and heatwaves that reduce offspring survival, while the cliffs of the cooler and wetter highland are buffering the overall population decline. These findings suggest concrete conservation actions to halt the species' decline in the island. Installing thermally insulated nestboxes can mitigate the loss of lowland breeding sites and reinforce the highland population.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:56:31.064891
The use of Mediterranean native shrubs for improving the sustainability of urban environments,"Luca Leotta, S.

The typical vegetation in this region is predominantly consists of shrubs. Due to their anatomical, morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, these plants can tolerate abiotic stress, particularly drought. Consequently, incorporating them could enhance the sustainability of urban green spaces. However, species native to the Mediterranean Basin are not yet widely represented in green spaces, despite their attractive ornamental traits. To quantify the contribution of Mediterranean native shrubs, a survey was conducted on Italian flora. Using a selection grid, species of potential interest were identified; these species belong to the Mediterranean chorotype and exhibit appealing ornamental characteristics. The overall attributes of these plant species support their ornamental use, owing to their form and the features of their leaves, flowers, or fruits. The investigation identified 369 species that are not currently available in commercial nurseries. The most represented families included  Rosaceae  ,  Asteraceae  ,  Fabaceae  ,  Lamiaceae  , and  Cistaceae  . Although the flowering period of each species is relatively short, the blooms of different species are distributed throughout the year.

Yet in practice, recovery processes often restore unsustainable systems under the guise of resilience or return to normal. This article examines whether, how, and under what conditions post-disaster recovery can catalyze transformative recovery pathways with a focus on climate mitigation and adaptation. Our study presents an interdisciplinary analytical framework that integrates insights from transformative research, sustainability transitions, and resilience thinking, providing a pragmatic heuristic to navigate post-disaster recovery efforts. We apply the framework to four case studies that represent different systems triggered by different disruptions: agriculture in Italy (drought), housing in Türkiye (earthquake), mobility in Spain (flood), and energy in Ukraine (war). Our findings across the cases show that most recovery efforts fall short of reconfiguring the systems in focus, primarily reproducing pre-disaster patterns, with recovery processes commonly characterized by siloed governance, technocratic fixes, and fragmented activities. Still, disasters can also open opportunities for new climate solutions, collaborations, and narratives that can challenge existing regimes and path dependencies. This is possible through addressing the enablers and barriers that cut across different spheres of transformations. Based on the findings, we argue that transformative recovery cannot be enabled purely through risk management, technical adaptation, or return to normal, but must engage with questions of power, meaning, and governance. The study offers researchers a lens to analyze transformation potential across various types of systems and disruptions and provides policymakers and practitioners with insight into the conditions that are important for transformative recovery.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:37.810880

Using Theil’s entropy-based H index and Shapley decomposition, segregation trends are analyzed at both micro and macro spatial levels, using two classifications: municipal districts and Urban-to-Extra-Urban (UEU) zones. The results reveal a duality in segregation processes, with micro-spatial level desegregation for all population sub-groups, offset by macro-spatial level clustering of migrant populations, especially, of Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans. In shaping these patterns, the study highlights the pivotal role of Italians’ resettlement in the spatial clustering of migrant populations. By distinguishing subpopulation-specific contributions to segregation changes, the findings underscore the importance of targeted urban policies, including affordable housing and improved infrastructure, to mitigate segregation. This research advances understanding of spatial assimilation and stratification dynamics, offering actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners. Future research should apply the proposed method to other cities to develop a comparative framework to address socio-spatial inequalities in Southern Europe.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:59:20.421875

Natural turfgrass provides optimal conditions at the beginning of the playing season but faces challenges under increasing field usage. Turfgrasses with high wear tolerance and quick recovery capacity are crucial for maintaining surface quality under intensive wear. Bermudagrass is the most used species in warm climates but needs winter overseeding in the transition zone. In Mediterranean climates, tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort, formerly Festuca arundinacea) has emerged as a promising species due to its tolerance to heat, drought, and salinity, alongside traits like deep rooting, shade adaptation, and wear resistance. The trial was conducted at the CeRTES experimental station in Rottaia, Pisa, Italy. Twenty-seven tall fescue cultivars and three cultivars of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) were hand-seeded on 3 November 2022, at a rate of 43 g m−2. The experimental design consisted of plots measuring 4.5 m2 arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of twenty-seven cultivars of tall fescue with the aim of using the species in soccer fields with a permanent stand approach, with no need to manage spring and fall transitions. The field study encompasses determinations referring to the establishment stage, the maintenance at low cutting height stage (20 mm) and the subsequent stage of soccer use under different seasonal conditions (autumn, winter, and spring). Results showed that certain fescue cultivars, notably ‘Essential’, ‘Eyecandy’, and ‘FAG3/19-20208B’, exhibited quick establishment and adaptation to low cutting height (20 mm), and performed similarly to the reference ryegrasses ‘Gianna’ and ‘Mercitwo’ in terms of wear tolerance and recovery capacity across the three seasons. Moreover, most of the tested tall fescue cultivars performed well at a 20 mm mowing height, maintaining satisfactory quality and density. Among these, ‘Eyecandy’ and ‘Foxhound’ displayed finer leaf textures, comparable to those of the reference ryegrass.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:37.810827
Future intensification of compound and consecutive drought and heatwave risks in Europe,"S. J. Sutanto, Confidence Duku, Merve Gülveren, R. Dankers, S. Paparrizos",2025,2025-10-09,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/38ea4749c7a02a06ff2ceaa8fcceaac441ceeeb9,"Abstract. The risks of extreme weather events, such as droughts and heatwaves, are expected to rise across Europe due to global warming, leading to more severe and worsening impacts. These impacts become even more pronounced when compound and consecutive (CnC) drought and heatwave hazards occur. Yet, most studies on drought and heatwave have focused on single hazard events rather than CnC events and their potential impacts. This study aims to identify the future characteristics of both single and compound drought and heatwave hazards across Europe. More specifically, we analyzed changes in the total number of events, average duration, total duration, and frequency. Droughts were identified using the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SMI) and heatwaves were detected using the Variable Threshold Method (VTM). Both hazards were assessed using bias corrected simulations from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) models from 1953 to 2014 for historical period and from 2039 to 2100 for future climate scenarios under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. Furthermore, we employ a machine learning (ML) approach to project the impacts of droughts and heatwaves, using Germany as a case study. The ML models were developed using hazard characteristics as predictors and drought and heatwave impact data as response variables. Results indicate that the number, duration, and frequency of both drought and heatwave events are projected to increase under SSP1-2.6, with even higher increase for SSP5-8.5, not only when analyzed independently but also as CnC hazards. This applies not only in the south but also across multiple other European regions. Drought hotspots were identified in the Western Europe, with projections showing an expansion toward the South and East under SSP1-2.6, and across nearly all of Europe under SSP5-8.5 except for the northern regions. Heatwave hotspots were primarily located in eastern and southern Europe, particularly in Russia, Italy, and Portugal. Future scenarios suggest that southern Europe will remain a key hotspot for heatwaves. The occurrence of compound drought and heatwave events was projected to increase sixfold compared to the reference period, while consecutive drought and heatwave events might rise by up to 3.5 times under SSP5-8.5. Additionally, results also reveal that drought impacts on economic, non-economic, and ecosystem sectors are projected to double in Germany, while heatwave impacts on human health and mortality may increase ninefold by 2100. Our findings highlight the need to consider CnC hazards and show once more the urgency of climate adaptation and mitigation in limiting impacts across multiple sectors.",,"drought and heatwave, drought",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:37.810913
Biometric and molecular responses to water deficit in two contrasting Italian durum wheat cultivars,"Martino Schillaci, Mauro Centritto, E.

In our study, we examined the response of two Triticum turgidum spp. durum cultivars, Marco Aurelio (MA) and Antalis (AN), to water deficit stress, focusing on biometric traits and the expression of selected genes in their shoots and roots. During the first part of the water stress cycle that lasted 25 days, MA and AN reached soil water content (SWC) of 14 and 25%, respectively. The applied water stress had a significant impact on plant growth, adversely affecting several biometric traits. Notably, the two cultivars showed distinct responses to drought: AN maintained root biomass, whereas MA sustained similar shoot biomass through spike production. Despite these differences, total plant biomass of the two genotypes did not differ under water stress conditions, suggesting an improved water use efficiency in AN. Gene expression analyses indicated a broadly similar stress response in both cultivars, marked by the activation of genes involved in stress response, hormone metabolism and detoxification pathways. However, two genes associated with flowering regulation, IAA15 and NTL3A, were specifically up-regulated in the shoots of MA plants under stress, enabling these plants to flower under stress conditions. The study examined how two durum wheat cultivars respond to water deficit at both the phenotypic and gene expression levels. While both cultivars showed similar reductions in biomass, they differed in water use and flowering time under stress, traits that could be useful for improving yield in dry climates. Early flowering response, particularly in the Antalis cultivar, led to improved water use efficiency (WUE) and may help avoid stress during the reproductive stage, potentially boosting yields.",,water,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:54.423674

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) delivers a wide range of free and open products in relation to atmospheric composition at global and regional scales. The CAMS Regional Service produces daily forecasts, analyses, and reanalyses of air quality in Europe. This service relies on a distributed modelling production by 11 teams in 10 European countries: CHIMERE (France), DEHM (Denmark), EMEP (Norway), EURAD-IM (Germany), GEM-AQ (Poland), LOTOS-EUROS (the Netherlands), MATCH (Sweden), MINNI (Italy), MOCAGE (France), MONARCH (Spain), and SILAM (Finland). The project management and coordination of the service is conducted by a Centralised Regional Production Unit. Every day, each model produces 24 h analyses for the previous day and 97 h forecasts for 19 chemical species over a spatial domain at 0.1 × 0.1° resolution (approximately 10 km × 10 km), with 420 points in latitude and 700 in longitude and 10 vertical levels. Six pollen species are also delivered for the surface forecasts. The 11 individual models are then combined into an ENSEMBLE median. In total, more than 82 billion data points are made available for public use on a daily basis. The design of the system follows clear technical requirements in terms of consistency in the model setup and forcing fields (meteorology, surface anthropogenic emission fluxes, and chemical boundary conditions). But it also benefits from a diversity in the description of atmospheric processes through the design of the 11 European chemistry-transport models (CTMs) involved.

We clustered environments into stress classes and computed a continuous similarity index to map analogue regions. Our results show that by the end of the century, most official value for cultivation and use (VCU) trial sites will face intensified drought and heat stresses, with stress combinations exceeding historical ranges. Current climate analogues for most VCU wheat trial sites in Central Europe are predominantly located in southern Spain, southern Italy, and parts of Greece, yet these analogue environments are projected to decrease substantially under high-emission scenarios.

However, since these forecasts can have substantial biases for certain areas, postprocessing raw forecasts can be crucial to providing adequate information. An innovative artificial intelligence (AI) postprocessing method based on fuzzy rule‐based systems (FRB) has been applied and compared with alternative procedures used in the Jucar River Basin. For this area, six seasonal forecasting systems from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and six variables (precipitation, minimum, average and maximum temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed) were considered. ERA5 was used as a reference dataset. Alternative postprocessing methods are linear scaling (LS) and quantile mapping (QM). For each system, variable, and postprocessing alternative, forecasting skill is measured using the continuous rank probability skill score (CRPSS). The results show that, except for precipitation, the relative performance of these methods does not depend on the forecasting systems but on the variable considered. FRB dominates in maximum and minimum temperature and LS in average temperature, and wind speed. However, LS shows the worst performance at maximum and minimum temperatures, while FRB never produces the least ability. In the case of precipitation, the classification between methods depends on the forecasting systems, with FRB yielding the best skill in the majority of them. According to the results in semiarid Mediterranean basins, FRB provides robust and skillful postprocessing across all variables and forecasting systems.",,"triggering drought early‐warning, drought early‐warning measures, Jucar River Basin, Climate Change Service",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T19:11:49.992705

The combined or individual action of certain climatic and environmental factors can lead to oak decline in various oak forest types. A study was conducted between 2015 and 2022 in southern Italy, encompassing thirty oak forest stands dominated by various Quercus species, including Q. cerris, Q. frainetto, Q. ilex, Q. pubescens, and affected by oak decline. The study employed field sampling, NDVI data, and remote sensing techniques. The distribution of the forest stands encompassed both the Temperate and Mediterranean bioclimatic regions. A total of 18 quantitative and 4 qualitative variables were recorded and subsequently compared with a damage severity scale based on field observations. The values of the variables were analyzed using both descriptive and multivariate statistics to ascertain their role in triggering oak decline episodes. It was found that eight variables were the most significant in explaining the occurrence of oak decline. These were the first-semester average rainfall (PL), average maximum summer temperature, Rainfall anomaly index, Downward shortwave radiation, Root zone soil moisture, and three indicators concerning the number, amplitude, and duration of heatwaves. Quercus pubescens forests were found to be the most affected by oak decline. The years 2017 and 2022 were characterized by high levels of stress, with the combined effect of groups of diagnostic variables in exceeding the critical thresholds proving decisive in triggering episodes of oak decline. A vulnerability map was finally created reporting three vulnerability classes for oak decline: low, medium, and high.

Extensively studied in the field of psychology, cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks, hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring, availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case (Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:59:21.957648

Hence, both agricultural practices and natural regeneration in these areas are hindered by poor plant establishment and growth. The use of plant growth-promoting (PGP) microorganisms has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance plant performance under these harsh conditions. Methods In this context, the aim of this work was to isolate and screen the PGP properties of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria from biocrusts in arid soils, representing a highly unexplored niche of microorganisms with potential application in agriculture and ecological restoration. We determined key PGP traits, including phosphate and potassium solubilization, growth under nitrogen-free conditions, siderophore and auxin production, as well as protease, lipase, DNase, amylase, catalase, and cytochrome-C-oxidase activities. Results Our results showed that, among the cyanobacteria analyzed, Nostoc commune CANT2, isolated from the province of Almería (Spain), exhibited the highest number of PGP properties, followed by N. commune AB55 (southern Sardinia, Italy) and Trichocoleus cf. desertorum CAU7 (Almería). Both strains AB55 and CANT2 are characterized by their production of exopolysaccharides (EPS). Regarding the heterotrophic bacterial strains, those with the best PGP properties were identified as Peribacillus frigoritolerans and Bacillus atrophaeus by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Seed biopriming experiments with the model plant Triticum aestivum showed that application of N. commune CANT2, either alone or in combination with P. frigoritolerans 1E, enhanced vigor indices by up to 58% compared to the control. Discussion These findings highlight the potential of combined microbial consortia with PGP activities as candidates for the development of biostimulants, offering a sustainable approach to improve plant growth and resilience in dryland agriculture.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:53.197365

This activity was carried out to integrate the various studies conducted in recent years by the Iuav University of Venice, the outcomes of the CORILA Venezia2021 research and the general aspects of the Venice Climate Change Adaptation Plan, as well as in coordination with the contents of the UNESCO, ICOMOS International and Europa Nostra documents and with other national (PNIEC, PNAC, PTE) and EU documents. The analysis of impacts and risks to cultural heritage is provided both with regard to the effects of gradual changes in climatic parameters (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, etc.) and with regard to possible damages caused by extreme events (floods, heavy rain, prolonged drought periods). The effects considered to be potentially more damaging were associated with risks/threats for macro morphological/typological categories of cultural assets identified in the existing cultural heritage, also considering the effects of activating the MOSE system. The analytical campaigns also involved several Iuav laboratories such as Lama, FisTec and Geomatics CIRCE. The conclusion of the research saw the elaboration of a series of actions to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change, calibrated taking into account the characteristics of the assets belonging to the different macro-categories identified, and referable to both the punctual intervention and the preventive conservation plan, aimed at increasing specific resilience.

Climatic data from the Bolsena Meteorological Station were analysed alongside in situ water quality measurements collected near the archaeological remains at a depth of 4 m. The key parameters included water temperature (Tw), redox potential (Eh), dissolved oxygen (DO), and total dissolved solids (TDS). Trend analyses using the Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope revealed significant increases in air and water temperatures, which were strongly correlated. Although precipitation exhibited an upward trend, its negative correlation with temperature suggests greater variability rather than a stable water supply. Despite increased rainfall, lake levels showed a significant decline, likely due to intensified evaporation and water extraction for irrigation. UAV surveys confirmed recent lowering of the lake’s water surface during drought periods. Among the limnological parameters, dissolved oxygen saturation declined significantly, while redox potential increased, indicating shifts toward more anaerobic conditions. These environmental changes could promote the activity of erosive bacteria that degrade submerged wood. Conversely, increased evaporation might also enhance oxygen penetration at depth, potentially activating decay agents such as soft rot fungi and wood-boring bacteria. Overall, the findings suggest that ongoing climatic changes are adversely affecting the preservation of submerged wooden structures, highlighting the need for adaptive management strategies to protect both the lake ecosystem and its archaeological heritage.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:37.810874

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adopting a new mowing technology can support or enhance current low-input strategies in turfgrass management, such as reducing synthetic fertilization and deficit irrigation. This study was conducted from September 2023 to October 2024 at the Centre for Research on Turfgrass for Environment and Sports (CeRTES) in Pisa, Italy. Two turf compositions, pure tall fescue and tall fescue–microclover mixture, were managed using an autonomous mower operating daily at three mowing heights, 20, 40 and 60 mm. Turf quality, color, the NDVI, weed cover, leaf morphology, and clover presence were assessed throughout the growing season, including a drought and recovery period. The experimental design consisted of a two-factor split-plot randomized complete block design with four replications, and the statistical approach used was two-way and one-way ANOVAs with Fisher’s LSD at p = 0.05. The results of the study indicated that, under conditions where an autonomous mower was set to operate on a daily basis, the selected mowing height had minimal influence on drought response or recovery when water availability was a limiting factor. Furthermore, when subjected to the lowest mowing heights, the legume species included in the turfgrass mix demonstrated strong resilience, maintaining its presence and performance. In addition, when mowing with a high mowing frequency and at low mowing heights, the overall quality of the turfgrass appeared enhanced. These results serve as an important starting point for considering autonomous mowing technology as an innovative strategy in advancing toward turf management systems that prioritize sustainability and efficient use of resources.",,"inputs raise sustainability, raise sustainability concerns, sustainability concerns due",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:04.862214

Over the last several decades, the Umbria region of central Italy, with its long-standing olive-growing tradition, has experienced a rise in extreme summer droughts, severely impacting water availability. This makes it an ideal case study for investigating olive tree responses to climatic stress. In this study, we examined the adaptive strategies of three economically important cultivars – Arbequina, Arbosana, and Koroneiki – grown as mature trees (7 years old) between 2020 and 2023. We combined dendrochronological techniques, wood anatomical analyses, and intra-seasonal δ¹³C profiling to assess growth dynamics, structural adjustments, and eco-physiological responses across four growing seasons. Our results revealed distinct cultivar-specific strategies in response to climate variation. In Arbequina and Arbosana, δ¹³C values showed significant correlations with current-year spring and summer climate conditions, as well as with conditions during the preceding winter, reflecting a more isohydric behavior. In contrast, Koroneiki exhibited a more anisohydric strategy: its δ¹³C values were primarily influenced by precipitation from the previous winter, indicating a reliance on stored carbon reserves to support early-season growth. Wood anatomical traits further supported these differences. Koroneiki exhibited higher vessel density and a greater proportion of lumen area, traits that enhance water transport efficiency. It also achieved the highest stem basal area and fruit production among the three cultivars, reaching 10.2 kg/tree in 2023. These characteristics highlight Koroneiki’s potential as a drought-resilient cultivar suited for future orchard designs in Mediterranean regions increasingly affected by heat and water stress.",,climate variability,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:04.862147

We conducted a microcosm experiment with a Greenlandic soil subjected to five levels of drought, reducing water content from 180% to 15% over the course of 3 weeks followed by rewetting, mimicking a natural drought event. We linked changes in microbial gene expression related to stress response as well as C and N cycling with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil C and N status. Maximum changes in gene expression occurred at intermediate levels of drought (80% water content), characterized by acclimation of microbial physiology to drought conditions, including production of osmolytes as well as cell wall and membrane modifications. This peak in gene expression changes marked a tipping point associated with a pronounced decline in microbial respiration as well as extracellular enzyme activities under more intense drought conditions. Interestingly, C‐cycling gene expression correlated with soil dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, NO3− and PO43− contents. Moreover, N‐cycling gene expression correlated with PO43− contents and with the activity of laccases. These findings highlight linkages between microbial C, N, and P cycling because of stoichiometric constraints under drought. 24 h after rewetting, we found a shift in microbial expression of C usage genes towards more labile compounds, and an increase in genes related to anabolic activity and signaling, but no signatures of stress responses, suggesting that the microbial community had overcome rewetting‐induced changes in osmotic pressure and allocated metabolic activity to growth. Overall, we show that microbial physiological drought responses and microbial resource usage related to C:N:P stoichiometry are key mechanisms of C and N cycling in the Arctic soil under drying and rewetting.",,drought,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:49:16.748767

Shrubs constitute a significant proportion of the plant material used in urban plantings. Because of their variability in size, form, and habitat requirements, they are helpful design elements for the greening of cities. Therefore, it is incumbent on practitioners to have detailed information about the tolerance of shrubs to environmental stresses to inform their choices. The increasing prevalence of dry and unpredictable rainfall patterns further compounds these. The issue of water stress represents a significant constraint for plants in urban environments. Consequently, those responsible for selecting plants for such areas must consider drought tolerance when making their choices. The objectives of this study were to ascertain the current availability of information regarding drought tolerance and the provision of ecosystem services of selected shrub species and to evaluate the extent to which this information provides guidance to practitioners. To achieve this, books, nursery catalogues, and academic articles were subjected to a review process. A total of 10 European nurseries were consulted to select five common and five uncommon low-growing shrub species for the subsequent literature screening. The species-specific information was extracted by considering findings concerning the tolerance to environmental stresses, the provision of ecosystem services, the recommendations for use in urban environments, and the natural habitat of the species. The findings indicated that extant information was available for most species. However, this information was frequently generic, contradictory, concerned with botanical characteristics rather than site-related information, or excessively focused on a singular stress factor in a controlled setting, thereby limiting its utility for practitioners. The knowledge documented in books is predominantly unsubstantiated and based on the author’s experiences and qualitative observations. These findings underscore the necessity for reliable quantitative assessments of stress tolerance in numerous widely used shrub species to inform professionals’ plant selections for urban environments and ecosystem services.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:49:16.748773

Indeed, there is an increasing focus on understanding shifts in precipitation events to monitor the risks of floods and droughts, as well as to ensure sustainable water resource management. This study compares four reanalysis and satellite precipitation products (ERA5-Land, CHIRPS, PERSIANN, and TerraClimate) with ground data from 2003 to 2022. Among the datasets evaluated, ERA5-Land has the best performance (overall) in reproducing ground data, with a minimal mean bias error (MBE) of 1.91 mm, the highest correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.93), and the most favorable Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE = 0.93). In contrast, CHIRPS, PERSIANN, and TerraClimate significantly underestimate precipitation as compared to ground data. The categorical metrics also highlight ERA5-Land’s superior performance in identifying wet months. Spatial analysis shows that ERA5-Land and other datasets generally exhibit agreement regarding precipitation patterns. However, PERSIANN displays notable variances, particularly in northern regions, where it overestimates precipitation. To investigate possible changes in precipitation patterns, a longer period (1983–2022) is selected for trend analysis based on gridded precipitation products. Sen’s slope analysis does not reveal any significant annual precipitation trend. In autumn, the PERSIANN dataset indicates a significant increasing trend of +1.81 mm/year, which is also confirmed by ERA5-Land (+2.68 mm/year) and CHIRPS (+1.34 mm/year), although without statistical significance.

However, the diffusion of these techniques may encounter obstacles deriving from the reluctance of farmers, who have to sustain costs in the introduction of new technologies whose production results are still uncertain, but also the resistance of the market, given the still widespread reluctance of consumers in accepting wine products derived from the use of these technologies.Using original survey data from 1,045 respondents, we examine Italian consumers' acceptance of and decision to buy NGT wine products. To achieve this, we developed two indicators to assess the quality of the information and the respondents' level of knowledge about NGTs, our topic of interest. These indices were incorporated into a regression model to analyse their effects on the propensity to buy NGT wine alongside the socio-economic characteristics of respondents, which were categorized through cluster analysis.Our findings suggest a reduction in Italian consumers' distrust toward these new technologies, possibly influenced by the European institutions' proposed regulatory revision.

The primary objective was to determine spatiotemporal patterns of ecological transformations induced by climate warming, with emphasis on land surface temperature trends, vegetation dynamics, water availability, and invasive species distribution. The integration of satellite-derived information proves essential for comprehensive monitoring of climate change impacts on agroecosystems, providing unprecedented spatial coverage and temporal continuity for detecting environmental changes at regional scales. The research was conducted using GIS technologies, satellite observation systems, and data collection through Giovanni, Copernicus, and EO BROWSER databases. Temperature data from the AIRS satellite (2010–2025), processed through the NASA Giovanni platform, revealed consistent increases in mean monthly surface temperatures, reduced snow cover duration, and intensified summer heat waves. Vegetation dynamics were assessed using NDVI, NDWI, and NDMI indices derived from Sentinel-2 imagery through EO Browser and Copernicus platforms. Results for Rivne Oblast indicate a notable extension of the growing season by more than one month, demonstrating adaptive shifts in vegetation development to new climatic conditions. In Odesa Oblast, significant decreases in plant moisture content (NDMI) were recorded, alongside reduced precipitation and surface water area, exemplified by the desiccation of Lake Putrene. This indicates growing drought risk and water stress in agricultural landscapes. The study also examined biological responses to climate change, focusing on the invasive freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. A clear correlation was identified between regional warming trends and rapid population growth and spatial expansion of this species in Volyn and Odesa oblasts. Data suggest that milder winters and narrower temperature ranges created favorable thermal conditions facilitating successful colonization. Comprehensive analysis of satellite data for the period 2010–2025 unequivocally confirms the presence of significant climate changes across Ukraine’s territory. The satellite-based monitoring approach demonstrates critical importance for early detection and quantification of climate-induced changes in agroecosystems, enabling timely implementation of adaptive management strategies. The identified trends—temperature increases, transformation of vegetation cycles, invasive species expansion, and water resource degradation — require immediate implementation of adaptive measures and comprehensive natural resource management strategies. Overall, the research underscores the potential of satellite monitoring for detecting climate-related ecological changes and highlights the indispensable role of remote sensing technologies in understanding complex interactions between climate variability and ecosystem responses.

The “spiral of silence” is a social feedback loop in which individuals are reluctant to speak about an issue because they believe they hold a minority opinion, leading to anxiety and fear, which prohibit action. Facilitating conversations about climate change is therefore a crucial step for researchers concerned with enhancing adaptive capacity. The goal of this paper is to provide a road map for engaging rural communities in conversations about their lived experiences with and local knowledge related to climate and water-related risks (e.g., drought). Our research focuses on unwinding the spiral of silence through community engagement to address the following questions: 1. How do rural Wyoming community members perceive recent climate conditions and water-related risks; and 2. How do rural Wyoming community members perceive and discuss future climate scenarios?Our first research question is addressed through analysis of results from a statewide survey, which are used to develop prompts for a scenario planning workshop to support the second research question. Our second research question is addressed through transcription and coding of recorded discussions and responses during and after participatory scenario planning workshops in key communities around the state.Results from the statewide survey indicate that respondents largely agree that all seasons are getting warmer than in the past and that drought is the dominant water risk of concern; however, there is uncertainty about community preparedness. Inclusion of prompts in our participatory scenario planning workshops that were aligned with statewide survey results allowed shared communication opportunities among community members and identified local knowledge of past drought events and associated adaptation strategies for the future.Our mixed-method approach provides an example for unwinding the spiral of silence in rural communities experiencing challenges and impacts of climate change.",,climate change,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:54.423667

As one of the most fundamental human rights, access to proper housing is of critical importance. In this context, this study investigates how the spatial organization of temporary shelter camps affects user satisfaction across various international contexts. A web-based documentary analysis method was applied to examine nine case study regions that were significantly affected by disasters and conflicts in the 21st century. These regions, Sri Lanka, the United States, Haiti, Turkey, Japan, Greece, the Philippines, Nepal, and Italy, were selected through purposive sampling, based on the severity of the disasters and their impact on local populations. Data were obtained through the review of academic literature, media archives, and institutional reports, with affected areas identified accordingly. Triangulated analyses within the reviewed academic sources provided valuable insights into the conditions of temporary camps. The findings reveal pervasive security vulnerabilities, insufficient user-focused assistance from local governments and civil society organisations, feeble spatial design, poor sanitation facilities, and restricted access to social infrastructure. These deficits adversely affect psychological well-being and community integration. The study indicates that temporary shelters created during catastrophes and wars must adhere to international humanitarian standards, integrate adaptable and sustainable spatial plans, and get backing from local authorities and the Sustainable Development Goals through user-centred interventions.

Using the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12) and complex network methods, we reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought propagation, identifying key hubs and hot-spot regions. Our analysis identifies spatial hubs where droughts originate and terminal zones where impacts converge. This process follows a diffusive propagation mechanism, whereby local events spread through preferential pathways until they are interrupted by seasonal climatic conditions that restore precipitation regime. These findings enhance understanding of drought dynamics in interconnected systems, advancing the application of complex network theory to hydro-climatology.

With the rising of climate change impacts, automatic crop classification from remote sensing imagery plays an important role in monitoring drought risk especially in wide coverage areas. In this paper, we experimentally discuss and validate several clustering methods aimed at performing unsupervised crop classification of annual image time-series of the vegetation index called Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR). Specifically, the task of discriminating summer crops and winter crops in an unsupervised manner is addressed. The compared clustering methods range from classical techniques (e.g., k-means and Gaussian Mixture Model), to deep neural clustering algorithms, among which various architectures (Autoencoder, Variational Autoencoder, and Recurrent Neural Network) are included. The experimental validation is conducted in three different years over the Italian territory and in comparison to publicly available benchmark crop maps from different sources. The experimental discussion confirms the effectiveness of the considered techniques for the discrimination of summer and winter crops and highlights their advantages and drawbacks. Moreover, the use of annual FPAR time series as the input remote sensing data is observed to be effective, as the highest accuracy of each validation year reaches more than 90%, which may lead to beneficial contribution to the drought monitoring application.",,"drought risk management, drought risk, monitoring drought risk",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:53.197397

One such extreme phenomena is droughts. The recent wildfires in this region are a concerning consequence of this phenomenon, causing severe environmental damage and transforming natural landscapes. However, droughts involve a two-way interaction: On the one hand, climate change and various human activities, such as urbanization and deforestation, influence the development and severity of droughts. On the other hand, droughts have a significant impact on various sectors, including ecology, agriculture, and the local economy. This study investigates drought dynamics in four Mediterranean countries, Greece, France, Italy, and Spain, each of which has experienced severe wildfire events in recent years. Using satellite-based Earth observation data, we monitored drought conditions across these regions over a five-year period that includes the dates of major wildfires. To support this analysis, we derived and assessed key indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI). High-resolution satellite imagery processed within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform enabled the spatial and temporal analysis of these indicators. Our findings reveal that, in all four study areas, peak drought conditions, as reflected in elevated NDDI values, were observed in the months leading up to wildfire outbreaks. This pattern underscores the potential of satellite-derived indices for identifying regional drought patterns and providing early signals of heightened fire risk. The application of GEE offered significant advantages, as it allows efficient handling of long-term and large-scale datasets and facilitates comprehensive spatial analysis. Our methodological framework contributes to a deeper understanding of regional drought variability and its links to extreme events; thus, it could be a valuable tool for supporting the development of adaptive management strategies. Ultimately, such approaches are vital for enhancing resilience, guiding water resource planning, and implementing early warning systems in fire-prone Mediterranean landscapes.",,climate hot spot’,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:03.641151

(Crofton weed) is a triploid, apomictic perennial herb or sub-shrub native to Mexico that is highly invasive in many parts of the world. This species thrives in diverse habitats, from wet forest margins to dry slopes and disturbed urban areas. Initially introduced globally as an ornamental plant, it has now naturalized across many continents, including Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, often displacing native flora and altering ecosystems. Its introduction to Europe dates back to the 19th century, with naturalization first recorded on the French Riviera. Ageratina adenophora is now established in several southern European countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia, Greece) and across the Macaronesian islands. It spreads via wind- and water-dispersed seeds and can also propagate vegetatively, particularly along riparian systems and disturbed sites. Despite its prolific reproduction and adaptability, its expansion in Europe has so far remained moderate, possibly due to climatic limitations and unsuitable habitats. Ecologically, A. adenophora exhibits remarkable phenotypic plasticity and physiological adaptations that enable it to survive a range of abiotic stresses including cold, drought, and variable light levels. The species benefits from mutualisms with soil microbes and displays enhanced nitrogen-use efficiency in introduced ranges. Although initially valued for ornamental and medicinal purposes, A. adenophora is now widely recognized as a harmful invader. It invades both natural and semi-natural habitats and has demonstrated a capacity to alter soil chemistry, suppress native vegetation through competition and allelopathy, and host diverse pathogens and endophytes. Ageratina adenophora negatively impacts biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and agriculture by forming dense, monospecific stands and disrupting native communities. Its presence in biodiversity hotspots and protected areas—such as Himalaya, South Africa, and the Canary Islands—poses significant conservation challenges. Control efforts, including the use of biological agents such as Procecidochares utilis Stone 1947, have yielded mixed results. The most effective method for small areas is to physically remove A. adenophora before it sets seed. This can be done by hand-pulling or cutting. Given the continued spread and resilience of this species there is an urgent need for coordinated management strategies and increased awareness, especially in the face of climate change which may further facilitate its expansion in Europe and beyond.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:52:54.423690

It also addresses to land degradation, natural hazards such as fires and volcanoes, coastal and inland water management as well as urban heat island issues [1].

The mechanical design of the SWIR detector plane filter assemblies (DPF-SWIR) was developed by Fraunhofer IOF. A finite elements analysis shows that the design meets all the required mechanical and thermal loads [5]. To prove theoretical analysis, a mechanical model (MM) has been manufactured. The DPF-SWIR MM was designed to be mechanical flight representative. In consequence, optical coatings on the filter stripes and black coatings on the mechanical parts were absent. The assembled mechanical model was characterized by means of mechanical and optical methods. The single filter stripes position and wave front error were key characterization results.

Although historically characterized by abundant water availability, this area is now increasingly affected by drought risk. This study presents a two-year evaluation of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) on processing tomatoes in northern Italy. In 2019 (Parma) and 2022 (Piacenza), full irrigation (IRR, restoring 100% crop evapotranspiration) and RDI (100% IRR until the color-breaking stage, followed by 50% IRR) strategies were compared within a completely randomized block design. Overall, RDI resulted in a 25% reduction in water use without compromising yield, which was maintained through unchanged plant fertility and fruit size compared to IRR. Remote sensing data from PlanetScope imagery confirmed the absence of water stress in RDI-treated plants. Furthermore, increased soluble solids and dry matter contents under RDI suggest a physiological adaptation of processing tomatoes to late-season water deficit. Remarkably, environmental and economic sustainability indicators—namely water productivity and yield quality—were enhanced under RDI management. This study validates a simple, sustainable, and readily applicable irrigation approach for tomato cultivation in the Po valley.

However, rising temperatures and prolonged droughts significantly affect their physiological performance and growth dynamics. To assess their long-term responses to climate change, mature beech and Turkey oak trees were studied in Central Italy at an elevation of 450 m. Using dendrochronological and stable isotope analyses (1981–2020), their growth patterns and physiological adaptations were evaluated. Beech exhibited a higher growth rate, with a basal area increment (BAI) of 17.1 ± 1.1 cm2 year−1, compared to Turkey oak, showing a BAI of 12.7 ± 0.96 cm2 year−1. Both species actively responded to increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Additionally, spring and the previous summer’s climatic conditions played a key role in growth, while summer temperature and precipitation influenced carbon discrimination. For beech, correlations between BAI and iWUE (intrinsic water efficiency, defined as the ratio between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance) were initially weak and not statistically significant. However, the correlation became significant, strengthening steadily into the early 2000s, likely related to thinning of the beech trees. For Turkey oak, the correlation was already significant and strong from the beginning of the analysis period (1981), persisting until the late 1990s. Our findings suggest that both species actively adjust their iWUE in response to an increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, while Turkey oak’s iWUE and BAI relationship remains unaffected by the likely thinning, beech benefits from reduced competition for light, nutrients, and water. Despite climate change’s impact on marginal populations, microclimatic conditions allow beech to outperform Turkey oak, a species typically better suited to drier climates.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:56:31.064849

Focusing on Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece, it develops a multi-level analytical framework to explore how information asymmetries and governance fragmentation undermine coordinated responses to water scarcity. Integrating theories of information economics, polycentric governance, and critical institutionalism, this study applies a stylized economic model and comparative institutional analysis to assess how agents—such as farmers, utilities, regulators, and civil society—respond to varying incentives, data access, and coordination structures. Using secondary data, normalized indicators, and scenario-based simulations, the model identifies three key structural parameters—institutional friction (θi), information cost (βi), and incentive strength (αi)—as levers for governance reform. The simulations are stylized and not empirically calibrated, serving as heuristic tools rather than predictive forecasts. The results show that isolated interventions yield limited improvements, while combined reforms significantly enhance both equity and effectiveness. Climate stress simulations further reveal stark differences in institutional resilience, with Greece and Italy showing systemic fragility and Portugal emerging as comparatively robust.

Assessing their health is critical for sustainable forest management. This study integrated ecological indicators (tree density, size, regeneration, deforestation, slope, grazing, and erosion) with machine learning (ML) to classify forest health and identify key drivers across 37 Western Himalayan sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) reduced data dimensionality, highlighting major ecological gradients. K-means clustering was used to group forests into three distinct classes based on ecological characteristics, due to its efficiency in identifying natural patterns within multivariate data. ML models, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained and validated using an 80:20 train-test split and 5-fold cross-validation. PCA revealed that elevation, disturbance, and regeneration explained 74.3% variance. Forest health varied across sites, with 10 categorized as healthy, 19 as moderate, and 8 as unhealthy. Forest regeneration was highly skewed (2.67) and leptokurtic (9.8), with few sites showing high seedling abundance, while deforestation (mean = 294 stumps ha−1) indicated uneven human impact. Among ML models, RF showed the best performance with a mean accuracy of 0.83, Kappa 0.87, and balanced accuracy 0.88. SVM followed with 0.75 accuracy, Kappa 0.70, and balanced accuracy 0.81. DT performed lowest with 0.66 accuracy and Kappa 0.45. Cross-validation confirmed RF’s highest mean accuracy (90.3%), followed by SVM (88.1%) and DT (65.1%). RF-based feature importance analysis showed tree DBH, height, regeneration rate, soil erosion, and tree density as key ecological drivers of forest health. This study highlights ML-driven classification as a precise, scalable, and objective tool for large-scale forest health assessments. Conservation efforts should prioritize degraded forests through afforestation, slope stabilization, controlled grazing, erosion management, and continuous ecosystem monitoring. Future studies should integrate high-resolution remote sensing (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2) and climate datasets (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and drought indices) to enhance predictive capabilities and support long-term forest management planning.

To identify the best sites for an assisted colonisation of the species in the area, we carried out experiments posing 120 plantlets grown from seeds from the natural population in each of 5 sites within a 20 km range from the natural population. Environmental, demographic and meteorological parameters were monitored for 8 years at each site to evaluate the response to our intervention. Demographic changes occurred at different rates, reflecting the effect of environmental factors on new plants establishment and survival; the final survival rate of reintroduced plants was 45.3%. Unlike winter temperature, summer drought had a strong negative impact on plant survival. Inter-population comparison suggests a formerly wider distribution of the species, and bodes well for the survival of the newly created populations. Differentiating between ecological factors influencing growth and those regulating reproductive biology and success of new generations will help to improve long-term fitness and viability in assisted colonisation projects.",,"extreme climate events, climate events",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:04.862186

It is thus necessary to understand how management practices can mitigate the impacts of droughts on yields, harmful organisms and ecosystem service providers in different soil contexts. Soil disturbance reduction is often suggested as one such practice. In this study, we investigated the effects of drought (50% reduction in natural precipitation), tillage regime (conservation vs. conventional tillage), and the pivotal soil nutrient phosphorous on crop yield, as well as on the control of weeds, pests, and pathogens. We set our manipulative experiment in 18 arable fields in Northern Italy, and drought conditions were simulated with rainout shelters. Drought had a negative effect on yields and increased the biomass and species richness of weeds. Conservation tillage had lower crop disease incidence but higher weed biomass than conventional tillage. Drought and conventional tillage both reduced the number of synergies between the different ecosystem services indicators. Soil phosphorus increased weed biomass, but decreased disease incidence in soybean. Arthropod pests and predators were not significantly affected by any of the tested variables. Against the predictions, the effects of conservation tillage on drought mitigation and ecosystem services were mixed, indicating that complex combinations of multiple interventions will be required to reduce the negative effects of drought, weeds and pests under a changing climate.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:03.641145
Short-Term Forecasting of Crop Production for Sustainable Agriculture in a Changing Climate,"Vincenzo Guerriero, A. R. Scorzini, B. Di Lena, Mario Di Bacco, M. Tallini",2025,2025-07-04,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f552cc9d05f458754c9eba1009184e703283fa4b,"Globally, crop productive systems exhibit climatic adaptation, resulting in increased overall yields over the past century. Nevertheless, inter-annual fluctuations in production can lead to food price volatility, raising concerns about food security. Within this framework, short-term crop yield predictions informed by climate observations may significantly contribute to sustainable agricultural development. In this study, we discuss the criteria for historical monitoring and forecasting of the productive system response to climatic fluctuations, both ordinary and extreme. Here, forecasting is intended as an assessment of the conditional probability distribution of crop yield, given the observed value of a key climatic index in an appropriately chosen month of the year. Wheat production in the Teramo province (central Italy) is adopted as a case study to illustrate the approach. To characterize climatic conditions, this study utilizes the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) as a key indicator impacting wheat yield. Validation has been carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulations, confirming the effectiveness of the method. The main findings of this study show that the model describing the yield–SPEI relationship has time-varying parameters and that the study of their variation trend allows for an estimate of their current values. These results are of interest from a methodological point of view, as these methods can be adapted to various crop products across different geographical regions, offering a tool to anticipate production figures. This offers effective tools for informed decision-making in support of both agricultural and economic sustainability, with the additional benefit of helping to mitigate price volatility.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:57:39.052200

Climate change, with increasingly frequent and severe droughts, is expected to increase dependency on groundwater resources. To assess climate change impacts on the regional aquifer system, a high-resolution numerical groundwater flow model of a portion of Emilia-Romagna is implemented in MODFLOW 6, building on the data and previous model developed by the Regional Agency for Prevention, Environment and Energy of Emilia-Romagna (Arpae). The model simulates long-term scenarios, considering reductions of precipitation and increased groundwater abstraction over 12 years. Results indicate that the aquifer system is vulnerable to droughts, with intensified effects when groundwater pumping increases. Furthermore, areas where the impacts of reduced precipitation and higher abstraction are particularly pronounced are identified. These findings provide critical insights for the implementation of sustainable management strategies for the regional aquifer system during long-term droughts.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:49:16.748797

Forest fires and vegetation resistance to ignition during periods of drought are both strictly related to climate characteristics of the area. The contribution of this work is to evaluate the performance of vegetation drought models using field measured data (data related to local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity), data usually lacking. In the present work, moisture content of shrub vegetation and live foliage (fine fuels) were detected by field measurements of in Tuscany (Italy). In two plots of Quercus ilex L. and mixed broadleaves forest, seasonal and inter-annual variations of live fine fuels of several species are analyzed. The selected species constitute two sets (shrubs and trees) of vegetation typology characterized by a representative seasonal variability in mediterranean ecosystems. From nearby stations meteorological data were collected in each study area for the evaluation of fuel moisture indicators, including the Drought Code (DC) used in the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System. The results of the present work have shown that for the summer season the slow response of live fine fuel moisture content (LFMC) to meteorological conditions (namely to precipitation), was well described by the DC. Empirical correlations between LFMC and DC for each species and site are proposed.",,"Abstract Vegetation water, Vegetation water content",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:45:03.641165
Effects of Italian Mediterranean Organic Diet on the Gut Microbiota: A Pilot Comparative Study with Conventional Products and Free Diet,"L. di Renzo, G. Frank, Barbara Pala, Rossella Cianci, G.

While the Mediterranean Diet is known for its health-promoting effects, the role of food quality, specifically organic vs. conventional products, in modulating GM within this dietary pattern remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) whether an Italian Mediterranean Organic Diet (IMOD) confers additional benefits compared to an Italian Mediterranean non-Organic Diet (IMnOD), and (2) the impact of IMOD and IMnOD versus a free diet (No Diet) on GM and anthropometric parameters. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted on 39 healthy subjects. Eligible subjects were divided into the following groups: (1) 4 weeks No Diet, (2) 4 weeks IMOD, and (3) 4 weeks IMnOD. Microbiota profiling (16S rRNA sequencing), body composition (BIA), and dietary adherence (MEDAS, FFQ) were evaluated. Distinct microbial shifts following both IMOD and IMnOD compared to No Diet were revealed. Several taxa previously associated with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis (i.e., Anaerobutyricum hallii, Anaerostipes hadrus, and Dorea longicatena) were increased after both Mediterranean Diet interventions, while Parabacteroides distasonis showed a specific increase in the IMOD group. No significant changes in body weight or composition were observed. These findings suggest that adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, regardless of food source, reshapes the gut microbiota, while organic food intake may influence specific microbial trajectories. Our results support the relevance of food quality in dietary interventions.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-16T18:56:31.064909

"Isotopic Evidence from the Po River Under Prolonged Drought Conditions (Northern Italy, 2022–2023)","G. Bianchini, V. Brombin, C. Marchina, C. Natali",2025,2025-11-16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc1b92bd1a6a72cf3112fd32c1a396b4521df720,"The Po River, the largest watercourse in northern Italy, represents a fundamental resource for the socio-economic system of the Padanian Plain. Between February 2022 and February 2023, the basin was affected by exceptional climatic anomalies, with unprecedented high temperatures, marked precipitation deficits, and the most severe hydrological drought documented in the instrumental record. Po river waters sampled during this period showed variable increases (Na+, K+, Mg2+, HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−) or decreases (Ca2+, NO3−) in the geochemical composition of major ions compared to data from previous decades collected under various climatic and hydrological conditions In contrast, the water stable isotope composition (δ2H and δ18O) of the period 2022–2023 displayed distinct and peculiar signatures, ranging from −64.1 to −53.5‰ for δ2H and from −9.4 to −5.7‰ for δ18O, compared to historical averages for 1998–2014 (−71.3 to −58.0‰ and −10.0 to −8.7‰, respectively). These values indicate a strong enrichment in heavy isotopes, reflecting warmer and drier climatic conditions, comparable only to those observed during the severe drought of 2015. Two groups of data were identified: Group 1, showing affinities with Eastern Mediterranean precipitation, and Group 2, characterized by pronounced evaporative isotopic enrichment due to prolonged drought, as evidenced by strongly negative d-excess and LC-excess values, consistent with those from arid and semi-arid regions worldwide. This study demonstrates how climate change and increasing hydrological stress are altering the isotopic composition of one of Europe’s most important river systems. Stable isotopes provide a sensitive tool for tracing moisture sources, quantifying evaporative processes, and assessing drought impacts, confirming their role as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) in climate and water-resource studies.",Po,"largest watercourse, watercourse in northern",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:37:39.781918

Despite advancements in monitoring, the spatiotemporal propagation and interdependencies of drought events remain poorly understood. This study analyzes drought synchronization within the Po River Basin, a critical hydrological system contributing approximately 40% of Italy’s GDP. Using the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12) and complex network methods, we reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought propagation, identifying key hubs and hot-spot regions. Our analysis identifies spatial hubs where droughts originate and terminal zones where impacts converge. This process follows a diffusive propagation mechanism, whereby local events spread through preferential pathways until they are interrupted by seasonal climatic conditions that restore precipitation regime. These findings enhance understanding of drought dynamics in interconnected systems, advancing the application of complex network theory to hydro-climatology. They also provide a foundation for research on societal resilience to climate change and the development of adaptive strategies for sustainable hydrological systems.",Po,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:37:39.781947
More intense heatwaves under drier conditions: a compound event analysis in the Adige River basin (Eastern Italian Alps),"Marc Lemus-Canovas, Alice Crespi, Elena Maines, Stefano Terzi, Massimiliano Pittore",2025,2025-11-28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c71bae8d01666e8b9a8a08e1cacf9615001d759,"Abstract. The Adige River basin has been affected several times in recent years by concurrent very hot and dry conditions. In summers 2015, 2017, and more recently in 2021–2022, severe hydrological droughts compounded and cascaded with wildfire and heatwave events. The chained effect of snow deficit in winter, higher-than-normal temperatures in early spring and heatwaves during summer caused multiple drought impacts. Despite the severe consequences, the role of observed climate change in exacerbating the intensity of the drivers leading to specific hot and dry events and their potential impacts in this region remains poorly understood. A ranking of compound drought and heatwave events (CDHW) occurring in the Adige River basin between 1950 and 2023 was built using E-OBS precipitation and temperature observations. The ranking was based on a composite index considering both event intensity and the spatial extent of the affected area, derived from the Standardised Precipitation Index at a 6 month scale (SPI-6) and a heatwave definition based on daily maximum temperature (TX). The major 2022 CDHW event, which caused severe environmental and societal impacts in the Adige River catchment, stood out. Occurring in late spring (10–28 May 2022), it ranked fifth out of 119 events detected since 1950 and was the most intense CDHW event in the past 15 years. As one of the most recent and severe CDHW events, the 2022 event was selected for an in-depth characterisation and a climate change attribution analysis of both its meteorological drivers and hydrological impacts. The changing characteristics of CDHW events similar to that of May 2022 were investigated through a flow-analogue attribution approach based on the reconstruction of its atmospheric conditions using ERA5 geopotential height at 500 hPa. By comparing May 2022 CDHW flow analogues from 1951–1980 (low anthropogenic forcing) and 1992–2021 (moderate-high anthropogenic forcing), we found that heatwaves comparable to the one in May 2022 are now significantly hotter – by 1–4 °C – than historical analogues and occur in a much drier context, characterised by pronounced precipitation deficits. These conditions, along with earlier snowmelt and persistent precipitation deficits, might have exacerbated river flow reductions and water stress in recent years. Also, shifts in the timing of a CDHW event were found to significantly influence the severity of its potential consequences. However, extracting a reliable signal of future changes in the characteristics of CDHW events from climate projections remains challenging. Based on flow-conditioned analogues of the May 2022 event from 25 EURO-CORDEX simulations, more than half of the models failed to reproduce the observed sign of change in temperature and drought conditions. Unconditioned reconstructions showed closer agreement with observations, particularly for temperature patterns, but critical aspects such as the magnitude of the changes remained underestimated.",Adige,"Adige River basin, Adige River",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:46:03.772779
Climate Crises and Agricultural Drought: Evolutions in Water Scarcity Context at the Farm Level,"Silvia Chiappini, O. Cimino, C. Cardillo",2025,2025-06-09,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c7ff2f30ab43c46827340baffbe4a33ec9dc00e,"The ongoing climate crisis and growing water scarcity are exerting increasing pressure on agriculture in Southern and Western Europe, leading to reduced crop yields, greater risk of land abandonment, and deterioration of soil quality. Despite the extensive literature on irrigation and water use in agriculture, the specific relationship between irrigation availability and changes in the type of farming (ToF) remains insufficiently investigated. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing data from the 2010 and 2020 Italian General Agricultural Censuses conducted by ISTAT, in combination with microdata from the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), focusing on irrigated farms in Southern Italy. Descriptive analysis reveals that over 60% of irrigated farms specialize in permanent crops and predominantly adopt efficient irrigation systems such as drip irrigation. Between 2010 and 2020, approximately 23.8% of farms changed their ToF; however, these transitions were not generally associated with improvements in productivity or profitability. Results from logistic regression models suggest that structural variables—including Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA), economic size, and demographic characteristics such as the farmer’s gender—play a more significant role in determining changes in the ToF than the presence of irrigation itself. Moreover, the adoption of organic practices and larger farm sizes are positively associated with ToF changes. These findings suggest that while there has been some shift toward less water-demanding and potentially more sustainable crops, the impact of irrigation on such transitions remains limited. The results underscore the need for more targeted agricultural policies and improved data collection to support effective climate adaptation strategies in the sector.",,growing water scarcity,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:51:19.620072
Thirst for Change in Water Governance: Overcoming Challenges for Drought Resilience in Southern Europe,Elenora Santos,2025,2025-07-22,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/78cb9137b0930bb7c2964547cefd6746fa3a70bd,"This article investigates the institutional and informational foundations of water governance in Southern Europe amid escalating climate stress. Focusing on Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece, it develops a multi-level analytical framework to explore how information asymmetries and governance fragmentation undermine coordinated responses to water scarcity. Integrating theories of information economics, polycentric governance, and critical institutionalism, this study applies a stylized economic model and comparative institutional analysis to assess how agents—such as farmers, utilities, regulators, and civil society—respond to varying incentives, data access, and coordination structures. Using secondary data, normalized indicators, and scenario-based simulations, the model identifies three key structural parameters—institutional friction (θi), information cost (βi), and incentive strength (αi)—as levers for governance reform. The simulations are stylized and not empirically calibrated, serving as heuristic tools rather than predictive forecasts. The results show that isolated interventions yield limited improvements, while combined reforms significantly enhance both equity and effectiveness. Climate stress simulations further reveal stark differences in institutional resilience, with Greece and Italy showing systemic fragility and Portugal emerging as comparatively robust. This study contributes a flexible, policy-relevant tool for diagnosing governance capacity and informing reform strategies while also underscoring the need for integrated, equity-oriented approaches to adaptive water governance.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:51:19.620102
Climate-Adaptive Irrigation Management in Venetian Reclamation Consortia (Italy),"Francesco Salmaso, A. Cogato, Lucia Bortolini",2025,2025-11-16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad87467805282570e9c78f14f7665816966298db,"Climate change poses increasing challenges to Reclamation Consortia, which must ensure equitable and sustainable water distribution under conditions of growing scarcity. This study evaluates supplemental irrigation management strategies adopted by three Reclamation Consortia in the Venetian Plain (Northeast Italy): Piave, Veneto Orientale and Acque Risorgive. The Consortia were selected based on their territorial and structural characteristics, as well as their different approach to managing water resources. This study fills a critical gap by integrating FAO AquaCrop-based estimates of irrigation needs for the 2022 and 2023 irrigation seasons in maize, grapevine and radicchio with an institutional analysis of Reclamation Consortia, offering an innovative framework that links technical and governance aspects of sustainable water management. Results reveal considerable variability among Consortia in terms of organizational structure, technological adoption, and resilience to drought. The 2022 season, characterized by extreme drought, required substantially higher irrigation volumes across all crops and soil types with significant differences compared to 2023 (p < 0.001), particularly for maize and grapevine (73% more irrigation water in maize). Well-drained soils and sprinkler irrigated crops showed the highest water demand (+45 mm compared to drip irrigation, p = 0.058), while loamy soils and drip systems proved more efficient. The Piave Consortium demonstrated the most advanced management system, supported by digital tools and structured rotation schedules. Nevertheless, structural factors, such as geographic location and infrastructure capacity, play a critical role in shaping resilience, leading to higher vulnerability in Consortia like Veneto Orientale and robustness in Acque Risorgive during drought conditions (i.e., 2022). Overall, the findings highlight the need to strengthen the main pillars of adaptation in irrigated agriculture, i.e., technology (decision support systems), governance (inter-Consortium coordination), and infrastructure (storage facilities), to promote flexible irrigation planning, enhance adaptive capacity, and ensure long-term sustainability under changing climatic conditions. These strategies also contribute directly to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 2, 6, and 13 (Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, and Climate Action) by improving water use efficiency, securing crop production, and enhancing resilience to climate change.",,"sustainable water distribution, growing scarcity",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:51:19.620116

Biometric and molecular responses to water deficit in two contrasting Italian durum wheat cultivars,"Martino Schillaci, Mauro Centritto, E.

In our study, we examined the response of two Triticum turgidum spp. durum cultivars, Marco Aurelio (MA) and Antalis (AN), to water deficit stress, focusing on biometric traits and the expression of selected genes in their shoots and roots. During the first part of the water stress cycle that lasted 25 days, MA and AN reached soil water content (SWC) of 14 and 25%, respectively. The applied water stress had a significant impact on plant growth, adversely affecting several biometric traits. Notably, the two cultivars showed distinct responses to drought: AN maintained root biomass, whereas MA sustained similar shoot biomass through spike production. Despite these differences, total plant biomass of the two genotypes did not differ under water stress conditions, suggesting an improved water use efficiency in AN. Gene expression analyses indicated a broadly similar stress response in both cultivars, marked by the activation of genes involved in stress response, hormone metabolism and detoxification pathways. However, two genes associated with flowering regulation, IAA15 and NTL3A, were specifically up-regulated in the shoots of MA plants under stress, enabling these plants to flower under stress conditions. The study examined how two durum wheat cultivars respond to water deficit at both the phenotypic and gene expression levels. While both cultivars showed similar reductions in biomass, they differed in water use and flowering time under stress, traits that could be useful for improving yield in dry climates. Early flowering response, particularly in the Antalis cultivar, led to improved water use efficiency (WUE) and may help avoid stress during the reproductive stage, potentially boosting yields.",,water,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:51:19.620139
Sediment Assessment Using Coupled RUSLE-SDR Models of Future Mellegue2 Dam in Tunisia,"Sahar Abidi, Hammadi Achour, Fida Mouelhi, Omrana Aıdara, Mahnaz Gümrükçüoğlu Yiğit, Lamia Lajili Ghezal",2025,2025-12-06,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9acd8a32691c28c4a3b186aac695d6d14f198da,"Over the last 60 years, Mellegue1 Dam has lost approximately 80% of its original 268 million cubic meter capacity to siltation, reflecting broader Mediterranean basin patterns in which climate-driven erosion has exacerbated dam sedimentation rates. In response, the strategic building of the upstream Mellegue2 Dam is intended to address water scarcity, improve flood management, and ensure a continuous supply of water for agricultural and domestic purposes. This study fills critical knowledge gaps by integrating climate change projections with sediment modeling in Mediterranean semi-arid environments, developing spatially explicit conservation strategies using combined RUSLE-SDR and SWAT modeling, and evaluating management interventions under future scenarios using drought-flush erosion mechanisms documented across the Mediterranean basin. This study evaluates sediment dynamics in the Mellegue2 Dam watershed from 1993 to 2019 using an integrated RUSLE-IC-SDR modelling approach, with model validation performed using a three-tiered framework that included SWAT comparison, historical sedimentation records, and regional correlation analysis. The model performed well (NSE=0.78, R²=0.82), with an average annual prediction error of 12.3%, similar to verified Mediterranean erosion models. Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations, accounting for parameter variability in R-factor (±15%), K-factor (±20%), and C-factor (±25%), yielded confidence intervals of -18% to +22% for annual forecasts. The temporal study demonstrates drought-flush erosion mechanisms common to Mediterranean climates, with post-drought sediment outputs increasing by 40-60% above normal years, consistent with regional research from Spain, Italy, and Greece. According to the management scenario study, Mellegue2 Dam will lose 50% of its capacity within 24 years if no intervention is implemented. However, comprehensive watershed management based on proven Mediterranean basin conservation practices has the potential to increase operational lifespan to 75 years while also delivering broader environmental benefits. The study finds three priority management zones that require distinct conservation approaches, with the largest return on investment found on northwestern slopes with erosion rates of more than 12 t/ha/year. These findings contribute to better knowledge of climate-driven erosion processes across the Mediterranean and offer management solutions that can be applied to similar semi-arid watersheds.",,"Mediterranean basin patterns, Mediterranean basin",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:51:19.620149

However, the impacts of climate change, such as rising temperatures, lower rainfall, and more frequent extreme weather events, are increasing aridity in traditional wine-producing areas. These changes threaten the long-term sustainability of vineyards by reducing grape yield and quality. This study introduces a data-based approach to assess and map water stress in vineyard landscapes, using freely available satellite data from European and American space programs. The method combines several environmental indicators that reflect drought and plant stress, including land surface temperature, changes in vegetation health, rainfall shortages, and soil water availability. These variables are analyzed using a statistical technique that reduces complexity and highlights dominant patterns of stress across space. The approach was applied to the Negramaro wine district in Brindisi, in southern Italy, an area highly exposed to water scarcity. The analysis produced vulnerability maps that identify zones most at risk, supporting precise and adaptive vineyard management strategies. These include optimized irrigation, better canopy management, and soil conservation measures. This method also supports broader planning efforts, such as climate-smart farming policies, remote sensing-based insurance schemes, and environmental subsidy targeting. The study shows that satellite data and statistical tools can guide practical solutions to climate challenges in agriculture.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:51:19.620157
Water Resources for Hydrogen Production in Wyoming,"E. Holubnyak, D. Jones, S. Buckhold, and C.

Hydrogen is one of the most exciting mediums for energy storage and transmission, requiring about 10kg of water for every 1kg of hydrogen produced. Water has variable quality, making it more or less suitable for Hydrogen production. Water access and rights are complex and vary depending on the jurisdiction. Therefore, water resource characterization, treatment procedures, and waste disposal techniques are essential for the new Hydrogen economy.  Wyoming is the fifth driest state in the nation. As a result, freshwater access can be a limiting factor in the hydrogen production process as the rising population and regional droughts create uncertainty over freshwater availability. Despite hydrogen production's relatively low water demands - requiring less than 1% of the water used in Wyoming's agriculture by 2050 - introducing new water-consuming energy production faces public scrutiny. The resistance largely stems from concerns over water scarcity and the competition with existing water uses under the state's strict prior appropriation water rights system. Additionally, the lack of public awareness about the water requirements for each hydrogen production method further exacerbates negative attitudes. To ameliorate the issues of scarcity and public opposition, there is a proposal to use treated produced oil and gas water (PW) for hydrogen production.  The produced water market itself is a potential source of revenue for the state of Wyoming- currently, the United States oilfield water management market is valued at $37.5 billion. The Permian Basin is an example of an area that began to capitalize on its produced water resources. Although the Permian PW salinity is 8 to 10 times the salinity in Wyoming, the PW hauling market there has grown by 12% yearly since 2018. Treatment costs remain the most significant barrier to the beneficial reuse of produced water. As the freshwater resources become scarcer and the market for PW grows, incentives are strengthened to further the R&D of economical water treatment technologies.  Hydrogen Energy Research Center at the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources H2ERC has partnered with Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Wyoming Energy Authority, U.S. Department of Energy, and two commercial companies to demonstrate a technology to desalinate produced water with heat and pressure, and then to maintain that heat to perform steam methane reforming with minimal energy input. This clever integration of water treatment and hydrogen generation will output 1 ton of hydrogen per day and be modular. The project will carry out a pilot-scale field demonstration of hydrogen production using produced water at a cost of 15% below existing methods ($1.30-$2.10/kg of H2), with the goal of reaching the DOE’s target of $1 per kg by 2030.",,"water, produced water",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:52:22.902606

The “spiral of silence” is a social feedback loop in which individuals are reluctant to speak about an issue because they believe they hold a minority opinion, leading to anxiety and fear, which prohibit action. Facilitating conversations about climate change is therefore a crucial step for researchers concerned with enhancing adaptive capacity. The goal of this paper is to provide a road map for engaging rural communities in conversations about their lived experiences with and local knowledge related to climate and water-related risks (e.g., drought). Our research focuses on unwinding the spiral of silence through community engagement to address the following questions: 1. How do rural Wyoming community members perceive recent climate conditions and water-related risks; and 2. How do rural Wyoming community members perceive and discuss future climate scenarios?Our first research question is addressed through analysis of results from a statewide survey, which are used to develop prompts for a scenario planning workshop to support the second research question. Our second research question is addressed through transcription and coding of recorded discussions and responses during and after participatory scenario planning workshops in key communities around the state.Results from the statewide survey indicate that respondents largely agree that all seasons are getting warmer than in the past and that drought is the dominant water risk of concern; however, there is uncertainty about community preparedness. Inclusion of prompts in our participatory scenario planning workshops that were aligned with statewide survey results allowed shared communication opportunities among community members and identified local knowledge of past drought events and associated adaptation strategies for the future.Our mixed-method approach provides an example for unwinding the spiral of silence in rural communities experiencing challenges and impacts of climate change.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:52:22.902664

Zooarchaeological studies from several Mousterian contexts show that Apulian Neanderthals may have responded to this crisis by increasing the exploitation of ungulates. In particular, bone grease rendering was likely one of the dominant activities conducted on-site. Anthropologists and nutritionists have long recognized that the diets of modern-day hunter-gatherers may represent a reference standard for human nutrition in the past and a model for their adaptation to specific environmental conditions. In addition, evaluating of certain qualitative and quantitative aspects of the animal/plant nutrient intake and absorption may provide important information regarding the nutritional needs and the physiology of these human groups. In this analysis, we combine ethnographic data related to animal economic subsistence patterns of hunter-gatherers, zooarchaeological data from Late Mousterian assemblages located in Apulia, the physiology of medium-large ungulates, as well as new paleo genomic analyses of Neanderthals and modern humans.

While growth dominance and tree size inequality are widely used to describe competitive interactions, their relationship remains poorly understood in managed forests. This study examines the links between growth dominance, tree size inequality, stocking density, and climatic conditions in silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) dominated stands. Using data from circular 109 plots established across four sites in Germany, Italy, and Poland, and incre­ment cores from 386 silver fir and 77 European beech trees, we fitted generalized additive models (GAM) to reconstruct individual tree growth and a piecewise structural equation model (SEM) to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of stand structure and climate aridity on growth dominance. The fitted GAMs showed moderate to high explanatory power (adjusted R² = 0.48–0.77). The SEM ex­plained a substantial proportion of variance in growth dominance (marginal R² = 0.57). Growth dominance increased strongly with tree size inequality (standardized estimate = 0.635), while climate aridity reduced it directly (–0.321) and indirectly through negative effects on tree size inequality (–0.324) and stocking density (–0.404). The total effect of climate aridity on growth dominance was substantial (–0.472). These findings demonstrate that growth dominance is an emergent property shaped by resource competi­tion, disturbance, and management legacies. Recognizing this is crucial for forest science and management, as it helps disentangle competition modes and highlights the need to integrate stand structure and com­petitive dynamics into silvicultural planning to sustain the stability and productivity of silver fir dominated stands.",,key driver,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:55:32.342465

Schreb. ar. ‘Aureus’), common thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus Spenn. ‘Severn seas’), mint (Mentha spicata L. ‘Moroccan’), and sage (Salvia officinalis L. subsp. Officinalis). Due to the rotating solar panels, two distinct ground zones were identified: a consistently shaded area under the panels (UP), and a partially shaded area between the panels (BP). These were compared to an adjacent full-sun control area (T). Microclimate parameters, including solar radiation, air and leaf infrared temperature, and soil temperature, were recorded throughout the cultivation season. Reference evapotranspiration (ETO) was calculated using Turc’s method, and crop evapotranspiration (ETC) was estimated with species-specific crop coefficients (KC). Results showed significantly lower microclimatic values in the UP plot compared to both BP and especially T, resulting in ETC reductions of 81.1% in UP and 13.1% in BP relative to T, an advantage in water-scarce environments. Growth and yield responses varied among species and treatment plots. Except for mint, all species showed a significant reduction in fresh biomass (40.1% to 48.8%) under the high shading of UP compared to T. However, no biomass reductions were observed in BP. Notably, essential oil yields were higher in both UP and BP plots (0.60–2.63%) compared to the T plot (0.51–1.90%). These findings demonstrate that dynamic AV systems can enhance water use efficiency and essential oil yield, offering promising opportunities for sustainable, high-quality medicinal crop production in arid and semi-arid regions.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:55:32.342505

This study provides a nutritional characterization of annual (Salicornia europaea) and perennial (Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocaulon macrostachyum) species of glasswort, collected from different coastal habitats in southern Italy. S. europaea was also cultivated under non-saline conditions. Results showed differences in mineral content, and bioactive compounds among genotypes, but they were modulated by environmental conditions, leading to significant site-specific variation. S. europaea, regardless of the collecting sites, exhibited the highest concentration of minerals (K, Ca, and Mg), chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds as well as antioxidant activity. A. macrostachyum stood out for its high flavonoid and sterol content, exhibiting other nutritional traits comparable to S. europaea when collected in a more arid site. A. macrostachyum and S. fruticosa displayed similar compositional features, showing the highest anthocyanin and iodine (187.8 µg 100 g−1 FW, on average) content. Sodium and potassium—critical for hypertension management—varied, exceeding the recommended Na/K ratio (1) for human consumption, especially in A. macrostachyum grown close to the sea. The most promising result was observed in non-saline S. europaea and in an A. macrostachyum sample (1.7, on average).

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) delivers a wide range of free and open products in relation to atmospheric composition at global and regional scales. The CAMS Regional Service produces daily forecasts, analyses, and reanalyses of air quality in Europe. This service relies on a distributed modelling production by 11 teams in 10 European countries: CHIMERE (France), DEHM (Denmark), EMEP (Norway), EURAD-IM (Germany), GEM-AQ (Poland), LOTOS-EUROS (the Netherlands), MATCH (Sweden), MINNI (Italy), MOCAGE (France), MONARCH (Spain), and SILAM (Finland). The project management and coordination of the service is conducted by a Centralised Regional Production Unit. Every day, each model produces 24 h analyses for the previous day and 97 h forecasts for 19 chemical species over a spatial domain at 0.1 × 0.1° resolution (approximately 10 km × 10 km), with 420 points in latitude and 700 in longitude and 10 vertical levels. Six pollen species are also delivered for the surface forecasts. The 11 individual models are then combined into an ENSEMBLE median. In total, more than 82 billion data points are made available for public use on a daily basis. The design of the system follows clear technical requirements in terms of consistency in the model setup and forcing fields (meteorology, surface anthropogenic emission fluxes, and chemical boundary conditions). But it also benefits from a diversity in the description of atmospheric processes through the design of the 11 European chemistry-transport models (CTMs) involved. The present article aims to provide a comprehensive technical documentation, both for the setup and for the diversity of CTMs involved in the service. We also include an overview of the main output products, their public dissemination, and the related evaluation and quality control strategy.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:55:32.342554

Adaptation strategies, such as introducing low-input and resilient crops, are essential. Moringa oleifera Lam., a drought-tolerant tree native to north-west India, has emerged as a promising candidate due to its high nutritional value, rapid growth, and adaptability to arid environments.This study evaluated the effects of planting methods and spacing on the growth and leaf nutrient composition of M. oleifera in Sicily (southern Italy), a semiarid Mediterranean environment. The experiment was conducted over two growing seasons (2021–2022). In 2021, four treatment plots were tested: two planting methods (seeding, S; transplanting, T) and two spacings (50 cm and 100 cm). In 2022, based on 2021 results, two plots were maintained to assess spacing effects (50 and 100 cm) under transplanting.Transplanted plants (T) showed higher values than seeded (S) in plant height and biomass production. The T50 treatment reached the highest leaf biomass (15 kg ha−1) and nutrient accumulation. Total nitrogen content was 27 kg ha−1 in 2021 and 125 kg ha−1 in 2022 in T50. Similar trends were observed for phosphorus, calcium, potassium, and magnesium concentrations.Results demonstrate that M. oleifera maximizes growth and nutrient uptake when transplanted at 50 cm spacing. This cultivation approach supports its potential as a viable alternative crop in semiarid Mediterranean systems, promoting agricultural diversification and resilience for farmers.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:56:35.830083

Stem water potential (Ψ-stem) is a reliable parameter of plant water status in several fruit orchards, including olive trees. However, traditional in situ measurements of Ψ-stem are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and destructive, allowing only limited samples and repetitions. Remote sensing technologies could be a promising alternative to conventional methods for estimating Ψ-stem. In this study, we conducted field measurements of midday Ψ-stem in an irrigated olive orchard located in southern Italy during the 2024 growing season, between June and October. Multispectral remotely sensed reflectance data were also collected simultaneously with the time of Ψ-stem in-situ measurements, acquired by Next-Generation PlanetScope, a new generation of spatial and time high-resolution satellites. Successively, 37 vegetation indices (VI) were computed from the PlanetScope images, and they were tested as proxies for Ψ-stem. A Random Forest (RF) model was used to perform multivariable regression, providing an accurate prediction of olive water status. The correlation coefficient between in-situ measured Ψ-stem and predicted Ψ-stem of the RF model is equal to R2 = 0.91 in training and R2 = 0.73 in test. Moreover, RF has given information about the importance of each VI in the regression estimates, furnishing useful insights about VI more involved in the Ψ-stem estimation.",,"plant water status, water status, plant water",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:56:35.830112

Bibliographic analysis has revealed a concentration of papers in semi‐arid areas, especially in Spain and Turkey. The meta‐analysis allowed a comprehensive diagnosis of CIAs operating in four countries (Italy, Malaysia, Spain and Turkey). The good performance of the CIAs was clearly associated with the following factors: satisfactory coverage of irrigation services, water delivery efficiency, financial self‐sufficiency, capacity of fee collection and economic production. These factors included responses to smaller command areas, the prevalence of on‐demand water distribution methods and water‐conveying systems in pressured pipelines, and the significant presence of farm drip systems. In contrast, the poorly performing CIAs presented poor irrigation service coverage and an excessive water supply to crops and personnel staff. These issues led to insufficient system operations as well as to poor economic performance, due to low financial self‐sufficiency, capacity of fee collection, economic production and high maintenance, operation and management costs.",,collective irrigation agencies,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:56:35.830137

In this work, we present a SPICE model for a 4H-SiC BJT and TTL inverter exposed to gamma radiation. The devices were fabricated using a dedicated SiC bipolar process at KTH (Sweden) and tested at the 60Co Calliope (Italy) facility up to 800 krad (Si). Experimental data, including Gummel plots and inverter transfer characteristics, were used to calibrate and refine a VBIC-based SPICE model. The adjusted model accounts for both bulk and surface degradation mechanisms by extracting parameters of forward current gain (βF), saturation current (IS), base resistance (RB), and forward transit time (TF). Results show a uniform degradation of BJTs, primarily manifested as reduced current gain and increased base resistance, while the inverter maintained functional operation up to 600 krad(Si). Extrapolation of the SPICE model predicts a failure threshold near 16 Mrad(Si), far exceeding the tolerance of conventional silicon circuits. By linking radiation-induced defects at the material and interface levels to circuit-level behavior, the proposed model enables realistic design and lifetime prediction of SiC integrated circuits for satellites, planetary missions, and other radiation-intensive applications.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:56:35.830148

This study investigated the impact of irrigation regimes on the physiological performance of three BPG species—Arundo donax L., Saccharum spontaneum, and Miscanthus—with a focus on leaf gas exchange (net assimilation rate and transpiration rate) and instantaneous water use efficiency (iWUE) at varying levels of irrigation input, adopting a split-plot experimental design under the Mediterranean climatic conditions of Sicily (Italy). The results clearly showed that A. donax, a C3 species, outperformed the C4 species S. spontaneum and Miscanthus, exhibiting significantly higher stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis, especially under irrigated conditions. S. spontaneum demonstrated the highest iWUE, particularly in rainfed treatments, reflecting its efficient use of water. Miscanthus showed the greatest sensitivity to water stress, with a more pronounced decline in photosynthesis during drought periods.

While the Mediterranean Diet is known for its health-promoting effects, the role of food quality, specifically organic vs. conventional products, in modulating GM within this dietary pattern remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate (1) whether an Italian Mediterranean Organic Diet (IMOD) confers additional benefits compared to an Italian Mediterranean non-Organic Diet (IMnOD), and (2) the impact of IMOD and IMnOD versus a free diet (No Diet) on GM and anthropometric parameters. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted on 39 healthy subjects. Eligible subjects were divided into the following groups: (1) 4 weeks No Diet, (2) 4 weeks IMOD, and (3) 4 weeks IMnOD. Microbiota profiling (16S rRNA sequencing), body composition (BIA), and dietary adherence (MEDAS, FFQ) were evaluated. Distinct microbial shifts following both IMOD and IMnOD compared to No Diet were revealed. Several taxa previously associated with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) biosynthesis (i.e., Anaerobutyricum hallii, Anaerostipes hadrus, and Dorea longicatena) were increased after both Mediterranean Diet interventions, while Parabacteroides distasonis showed a specific increase in the IMOD group. No significant changes in body weight or composition were observed. These findings suggest that adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, regardless of food source, reshapes the gut microbiota, while organic food intake may influence specific microbial trajectories.

Nursing diagnoses (NDs), standardized representations of patient responses to actual or potential health problems, reflect nursing complexity. However, most studies have focused on the total number of NDs rather than the individual role each diagnosis may play in relation to outcomes such as ICU transfer. This study aimed to identify and rank the specific NDs most strongly associated with ICU transfers in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients. Methods: A retrospective, monocentric observational study was conducted using electronic health records from an Italian tertiary hospital. The dataset included 42,735 patients (40,649 adults and 2086 pediatric), and sociodemographic, clinical, and nursing data were collected. A random forest model was applied to assess the predictive relevance (i.e., variable importance) of individual NDs in relation to ICU transfers. Results: Among adult patients, the NDs most strongly associated with ICU transfer were Physical mobility impairment, Injury risk, Skin integrity impairment risk, Acute pain, and Fall risk. In the pediatric population, Acute pain, Injury risk, Sleep pattern disturbance, Skin integrity impairment risk, and Airway clearance impairment emerged as the NDs most frequently linked to ICU transfer. The models showed good performance and generalizability, with stable out-of-bag and validation errors across iterations. Conclusions: A prioritized ranking of NDs appears to be associated with ICU transfers, suggesting their potential utility as early warning indicators of clinical deterioration. Patients presenting with high-risk diagnostic profiles should be prioritized for enhanced clinical surveillance and proactive intervention, as they may represent vulnerable populations.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:56:35.830171

Hence, both agricultural practices and natural regeneration in these areas are hindered by poor plant establishment and growth. The use of plant growth-promoting (PGP) microorganisms has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance plant performance under these harsh conditions. Methods In this context, the aim of this work was to isolate and screen the PGP properties of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria from biocrusts in arid soils, representing a highly unexplored niche of microorganisms with potential application in agriculture and ecological restoration. We determined key PGP traits, including phosphate and potassium solubilization, growth under nitrogen-free conditions, siderophore and auxin production, as well as protease, lipase, DNase, amylase, catalase, and cytochrome-C-oxidase activities. Results Our results showed that, among the cyanobacteria analyzed, Nostoc commune CANT2, isolated from the province of Almería (Spain), exhibited the highest number of PGP properties, followed by N. commune AB55 (southern Sardinia, Italy) and Trichocoleus cf. desertorum CAU7 (Almería). Both strains AB55 and CANT2 are characterized by their production of exopolysaccharides (EPS). Regarding the heterotrophic bacterial strains, those with the best PGP properties were identified as Peribacillus frigoritolerans and Bacillus atrophaeus by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Seed biopriming experiments with the model plant Triticum aestivum showed that application of N. commune CANT2, either alone or in combination with P. frigoritolerans 1E, enhanced vigor indices by up to 58% compared to the control. Discussion These findings highlight the potential of combined microbial consortia with PGP activities as candidates for the development of biostimulants, offering a sustainable approach to improve plant growth and resilience in dryland agriculture.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:57:39.419440

This study investigates the morphological and anatomical traits of D. aegyptium across six distinct habitat types in semi-arid regions, which vary in moisture availability, soil texture, and levels of disturbance. We used one-way ANOVA and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to evaluate habitat-driven differences and identify key patterns of trait variation. We found significant habitat-induced differences in morphological traits such as stem length, root length, leaf length, and plant biomass. Stem length and diameter peaked in sandy and canal bank habitats, while abandoned land exhibited the lowest values. Leaf length was highest in canal bank habitats and lowest in abandoned land. Sandy places supported the highest biomass, reflecting optimal growth conditions, while abandoned land recorded minimal biomass. Anatomical traits displayed habitat-specific adaptations, with roadside habitats exhibiting the thickest root epidermis and sandy places showing the highest endodermis thickness. Leaf anatomical features such as vascular bundle dimensions and bulliform cell density varied significantly, reflecting adaptations to environmental stresses. PCA revealed that plant traits clustered according to habitat type, with traits such as stem length, leaf size, and biomass associated with resource-rich habitats like roadside and agricultural land, indicating habitat-driven differentiation and adaptive plasticity. These findings highlight the strong relationship between habitat variability and morphological and anatomical plasticity in D. aegyptium, providing insights into its adaptive strategies in semi-arid regions.

During floral dearth periods, natural forage is limited, leading to reduced colony strength and productivity. To address this issue, the present study evaluated the effects of different pollen-based diet formulations on colony activity and development during the summer dearth period. The four diets used were D1 (gram flour, turmeric powder, sugar powder, ground pollen, and honey); D2 (brewer's yeast, maize flour, skimmed milk powder, sugar powder, ground pollen, and honey); D3 (soybean flour, skimmed milk powder, sugar powder, ground pollen, and honey); and D4 (control and sugar syrup only), in three replicates each. Colonies received 100 g of diet weekly in the form of patties and were assessed for diet consumption, sealed brood area, and honey storage area. Results showed that T2 was the most consumed diet (38.52 g/colony/week) and resulted in the highest sealed brood area (545.95 cm²) and honey storage area (405.96 cm²), compared to control and other treatments. The study demonstrated that protein-enriched pollen substitutes, particularly those including brewer's yeast, maize flour, skimmed milk powder, sugar powder, ground pollen, and honey, can effectively enhance colony build-up and productivity during the periods of forage scarcity. These findings support the development of standardized supplementary diets to mitigate the adverse effects of seasonal dearth on beekeeping operations..

Results from the Italian and French stake farms are jointly analysed. The Italian stake farm consists of 13 stakes; continuous observations started at the end of 2010 with near-monthly sampling. Some measurements are also available for the 2006–2010 period from a previous stake farm. The French stake farm consists of 50 stakes; observations started in 2004 with yearly sampling during austral summer. Snow buildup measurements at individual stakes show a strong variability caused by the interaction of wind-driven snow with surface micro-relief. In the common observation period, the present Italian stake farm generally underestimates the SMB with respect to the French one, except for 3 years in which an overestimation is observed. Over the 2011–2023 period, the mean yearly accumulation recorded by the Italian and French stake farms is 7.3 ± 0.2 cm and 8.4 ± 0.1 cm, respectively. Bootstrap simulation has been performed to: (i) assess the significance of the differences between the two datasets; (ii) evaluate the effect on the measurements of the different size of the stake farms and their distance to the Station. The comparison of the observations with reanalysis datasets (ERA5 and MERRA2) and regional models (RACMO2.4p1, MAR3.12) indicates the former more in agreement with the observations. The potential interaction effect of the Station has also been investigated by analysing wind direction during snowfall events, suggesting that buildings may influence accumulation. In fact, in the hyper-arid environment of Dome C, snow accumulation is largely governed by post-depositional processes such as wind redistribution and clear-sky precipitation. Buildings alter the wind field, enhancing erosion beneath them and forming snowdrifts leeward and laterally, which may explain accumulation differences between the ITA and FRA stake fields. Additionally, two more stake farms, located 25 km North and South of Concordia Station, are also analysed to study the SMB gradient across Dome C, confirming previous results. On average, yearly SMB increases northward by 8 %–9 % over the 50 km span between the southern and northern stake farms. At Concordia, for the 2004–2023 period, a mean SMB of 27.21 ± 0.60 kg m−2 has been estimated, taking into account the uncertainty of the observations and of the snow compaction effect. Results are valuable for validating SMB estimated from reanalysis, regional climate models and remote-sensing data.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T22:57:39.419497

Nevertheless, inter-annual fluctuations in production can lead to food price volatility, raising concerns about food security. Within this framework, short-term crop yield predictions informed by climate observations may significantly contribute to sustainable agricultural development. In this study, we discuss the criteria for historical monitoring and forecasting of the productive system response to climatic fluctuations, both ordinary and extreme. Here, forecasting is intended as an assessment of the conditional probability distribution of crop yield, given the observed value of a key climatic index in an appropriately chosen month of the year. Wheat production in the Teramo province (central Italy) is adopted as a case study to illustrate the approach. To characterize climatic conditions, this study utilizes the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) as a key indicator impacting wheat yield. Validation has been carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulations, confirming the effectiveness of the method. The main findings of this study show that the model describing the yield–SPEI relationship has time-varying parameters and that the study of their variation trend allows for an estimate of their current values. These results are of interest from a methodological point of view, as these methods can be adapted to various crop products across different geographical regions, offering a tool to anticipate production figures. This offers effective tools for informed decision-making in support of both agricultural and economic sustainability, with the additional benefit of helping to mitigate price volatility.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:00:49.064447

Among the different fields of application, accurate SM measurements are becoming more relevant for all studies related to extreme event (e.g., floods, droughts, and landslides) mitigation and assessment. In this study, data acquired by the advanced microwave sounding unit (AMSU) onboard the European Meteorological Operational Satellite Program (MetOP) satellites were used for the first time to extract information on the variability of SM by implementing the original soil wetness index (SWI). Long-term monthly SWI time series collected for the Basilicata region (southern Italy) were analyzed for drought assessment during the period 2007–2021. The accuracy of the SWI product was tested through a comparison with SM products derived by the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) over the 2013–2016 period, while the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was used to assess the relevance of the long-term achievements in terms of drought analysis. The results indicate a satisfactory accuracy of the SWI, with the mean correlation coefficient values with ASCAT higher than 0.7 and a mean normalized root mean square error less than 0.155. A negative trend in SWI during the 15-year period was found using both the original and deseasonalized series (linear and Sen’s slope ~−0.00525), confirmed by SPEI (linear and Sen’s slope ~−0.00293), suggesting the occurrence of a marginal long-term dry phase in the region. Although further investigations are needed to better assess the intensity and main causes of the phenomena, this result indicates the contribution that satellite data/products can offer in supporting drought assessment.",,water cycle,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:00:49.064459

Moreover, they are regarded as notable natural and economic resources. Since the sustainable management of protected wetlands necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, the purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive picture of the hydrological, hydrochemical, and ecological dynamics of a man-made groundwater dependent ecosystem (GDE) by combining remote sensing, hydrochemical data, geostatistical tools, and ecological indicators. The study area, called “Le Soglitelle”, is located in the Campania plain (Italy), which is close to the Domitian shoreline, covering a surface of 100 ha. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), a remote sensing-derived index sensitive to surface water presence, from Sentinel-2 was used to detect changes in the percentage of the wetland inundated area over time. Water samples were collected in four campaigns, and hydrochemical indexes were used to investigate the major hydrochemical seasonal processes occurring in the area. Geostatistical tools, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA), were used to identify the main hydrochemical processes. Moreover, faunal monitoring using waders was employed as an ecological indicator. Seasonal variation in the inundation area ranged from nearly 0% in summer to over 50% in winter, consistent with the severe climatic oscillations indicated by SPEI values. PCA and ICA explained over 78% of the total hydrochemical variability, confirming that the area’s geochemistry is mainly characterized by the saltwater sourced from the artesian wells that feed the wetland. The concentration of the major ions is regulated by two contrasting processes: evapoconcentration in summer and dilution and water mixing (between canals and ponds water) in winter. Cl−/Br− molar ratio results corroborated this double seasonal trend. The base exchange index highlighted a salinization pathway for the wetland. Bird monitoring exhibited consistency with hydrochemical monitoring, as the seasonal distribution clearly reflects the dual behaviour of this area, which in turn augmented the biodiversity in this GDE. The integration of remote sensing data, multivariate geostatistical analysis, geochemical tools, and faunal indicators represents a novel interdisciplinary framework for assessing GDE seasonal dynamics, offering practical insights for wetland monitoring and management.",,seasonal water availability,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:00:49.064471

Italy and the Mediterranean area are increasingly affected by fires and in recent years they have dried up abruptly due to extreme climatic conditions that increase the number of continuous days without rainfall, as well as the duration and intensity of heat waves that increase the risk of wildfires. In this context, it is essential to implement countermeasures in order to better plan the territory, by means of monitoring tools that can guarantee optimal coverage of the areas under investigation, assessing risk conditions. This research was carried out using remote sensing products such as Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) by recording daily values of land surface temperature (LST), precipitation, total water storage anomaly (TWSA) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation anomaly (FAPAR), to explain the annual variance in the number of fires and the amount of area affected by fire in eastern Central Italy. The statistical technique adopted was multiple linear regression (MLR), which identified the most influential variables in defining the annual number of fires, Summer LST showed a partial correlation values of 0.85, followed by precipitation in April (-0.07) and November (-0.38), June TWSA (−0.68), March FAPAR (0.78) and June FAPAR (−0.12), in addition to a low value of collinearity between the variables. The model obtained with MLR resulted in an 84% explanation of variance, a result inferred from the adjusted R-square. For the burned area, the same variables were involved but produced a different outcome, explaining 60% of the variance. This suggests potential for future predictive scenarios using more suitable variables to assess fire spread.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:03:58.914965

A N-S cross-section through the city serves as the domain for this study and boundary conditions were derived from historical maps starting in 1884, long-term air temperature time series starting in 1700, and distributed land surface temperatures from Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing. The research quantifies the temperature variations in the shallow subsurface over the past 150 years (1875-2025), calibrating the model against groundwater temperature measurements, and predicts trends up to 2100. Current estimates indicate urban temperature anomalies up to +5°C at the water table depth, and an expansion of the SUHI along the two-dimensional cross-section from 3 km in 1884 to 9 km in 2025. The findings highlight the heterogeneous distribution of subsurface temperature anomalies, influenced by variations in the groundwater depth, flow patterns, land cover and urban and infrastructure expansion. Future projections suggest a further increase in subsurface temperatures, particularly in areas with shallow groundwater.

The combined or individual action of certain climatic and environmental factors can lead to oak decline in various oak forest types. A study was conducted between 2015 and 2022 in southern Italy, encompassing thirty oak forest stands dominated by various Quercus species, including Q. cerris, Q. frainetto, Q. ilex, Q. pubescens, and affected by oak decline. The study employed field sampling, NDVI data, and remote sensing techniques. The distribution of the forest stands encompassed both the Temperate and Mediterranean bioclimatic regions. A total of 18 quantitative and 4 qualitative variables were recorded and subsequently compared with a damage severity scale based on field observations. The values of the variables were analyzed using both descriptive and multivariate statistics to ascertain their role in triggering oak decline episodes. It was found that eight variables were the most significant in explaining the occurrence of oak decline. These were the first-semester average rainfall (PL), average maximum summer temperature, Rainfall anomaly index, Downward shortwave radiation, Root zone soil moisture, and three indicators concerning the number, amplitude, and duration of heatwaves. Quercus pubescens forests were found to be the most affected by oak decline. The years 2017 and 2022 were characterized by high levels of stress, with the combined effect of groups of diagnostic variables in exceeding the critical thresholds proving decisive in triggering episodes of oak decline. A vulnerability map was finally created reporting three vulnerability classes for oak decline: low, medium, and high. The analysis revealed that approximately 97% (116,700 hectares) of forest plots classified as vulnerable (31.7% of the total forest area in the study region) were categorized as medium or high vulnerability.",,increasing droughts,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:03:58.915032

We report on the magnetic and paleomagnetic investigation of the Ivrea‐Verbano Zone (IVZ), Western Alps, where metamorphic and intrusive lower crust rocks of Late Variscan‐Permian ages are exposed. We sampled 39 oriented sites along the Cannobina, Ossola, Strona, and Sesia valleys/sections. Low (0.27–2.1·10−3 SI) magnetic susceptibility (k) values were measured in metapelite‐metabasite metamorphic rocks from the Ossola and Strona valleys. There only two metabasite (one amphibolite and one granulite) out of 25 metamorphic sites containing pseudo‐single domain (PSD) magnetite yield 0.48–1.1·10−1 SI k values that remain constant until 550°C heating. K of gabbros‐granodiorites from Sesia valley mimic low values from metamorphic rocks, whereas at Cannobina valley one gabbro and one mafic granulite display values comparable to the two strongly magnetic sites from Ossola/Strona valleys. Peridotite lenses at Balmuccia and Finero similarly yielded low (0.24–5.5·10−3 SI) k values, consistently with their low (<20%) serpentinization. Remanence contribution is negligible, as (a) Q < 1 values imply remanent magnetization subordinate to induced magnetization, (b) paleomagnetic directions from most magnetic sites are scattered, and (c) remanence is unstable at lower crust temperatures. We conclude that IVZ lower crust rocks could not yield magnetic anomalies generated by Precambrian lower crust from continent interiors, and similar conclusions might stand for other Variscan‐age lower crust sections. Scattered high‐intensity metabasites could be candidates, if their PSD magnetite‐rich mineralogy dominated Precambrian lower crust.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:03:58.915045

The country’s complex climatic variability, extensive coastline, and low insurance penetration highlight the urgent need for robust, locally calibrated tools to bridge the climate protection gap. Building on the methodological framework of existing actuarial climate indices, previously adapted for France and the Iberian Peninsula, the index integrates six standardised indicators capturing warm and cool temperature extremes, heavy precipitation intensity, dry spell duration, high wind frequency, and sea level change. It leverages hourly ERA5-Land reanalysis data and monthly sea level observations from tide gauges. Results show a clear upward trend in climate anomalies, with regional and seasonal differentiation. Among all components, sea level is most strongly correlated with the composite index, underscoring Italy’s vulnerability to marine-related risks. Comparative analysis with European indices confirms both the robustness and specificity of the Italian exposure profile, reinforcing the need for tailored risk metrics. The index can support innovative risk transfer mechanisms, including climate-related insurance, regulatory stress testing, and resilience planning.

This study explores the relationship between total cloud cover (TCC), solar forcing, and mean annual temperature variability in the Mediterranean region, focusing on both the pre‐industrial and the modern era (1982–2022). Leveraging 41 years of contemporary cloud data from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites and historical records from Italy's Benevento Observatory (dating back to 1870), we identify a marked decline in annual TCC across both periods, coupled with rising mean temperatures. Regional analyses highlight substantial disparities in TCC reductions, with declines of up to 10% per decade in Sicily (Italy) and northern Tunisia. A pivotal change‐point in cloud dynamics emerges around 2001, marked by a transition in the relationship between galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and TCC from consistent positive correlations (1982–2001) to spatially varied patterns thereafter. This shift coincides with a notable reduction in high‐cloud coverage (HCC) over the central and eastern Mediterranean. While causality remains uncertain, correlations point to GCRs and North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (NA‐THC) anomalies as potential modulators of regional cloud dynamics. Contrasting pre‐industrial (r = 0.46) and modern (r = −0.69) correlations underscore the complexity of cloud cover responses, highlighting the role of atmospheric circulation and the need for further investigation into these dynamics and their implications for climate variability.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:03:58.915070

Using Landsat satellite data from 2015 to 2025, the research analyzes temperature variations to detect thermal anomalies and assess their impact on vineyard resilience. Surface temperature was derived using a single-channel algorithm applied to thermal infrared data, with atmospheric correction and emissivity estimation based on vegetation indices. Monthly and seasonal composites were generated to capture both annual trends and seasonal fluctuations. Findings reveal a consistent increase in surface temperature during the growing season, especially between June and August. The years 2022 and 2023 showed extreme heat events, with temperatures exceeding the 90th percentile. Variability within the vineyard suggests that topography, canopy cover, and management practices influence local thermal dynamics. Compared to the surrounding land, the vineyard exhibited a cooler and more stable thermal signature, indicating its potential role as a microclimatic buffer. However, rising extreme temperature events pose a serious threat to traditional wine-growing areas.

Avoiding gearbox failures, which can strongly impact the functioning of wind turbines, is crucial for ensuring high reliability and efficiency within wind farms. Early detection can be achieved though the development of a normal behavior model based on ANNs, which are trained with data from healthy conditions derived from selected SCADA variables that are closely associated with gearbox operations. The objective of this model is to forecast deviations in the gear bearing temperature, which serve as an early warning alert for potential failures.

Over the past few years, a lot of work has been done to improve and ensure data quality in the western Mediterranean Sea (WMED), but reliable dissolved oxygen (O2) data remain scarce. This is a critical gap as oxygen is a key indicator of marine ecosystem health and plays a central role in carbon and nutrient cycling. To address this gap, we compiled and rigorously quality-controlled a new regional-scale WMED dataset of O2 data from sensors mounted on conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) probes: CTD-O2WMED. This product includes over 1000 previously unpublished high-resolution vertical profiles of CTD-O2 measurements mostly collected within Italian cruises between 2004 and 2023. The quality control (QC) process involved sensor post-calibration against discrete Winkler measurements, primary screening, and a secondary check based on crossover analysis with reference datasets. Combined, this ensures the consistency of the final corrected CTD-O2WMED across both space and time. CTD-O2WMED provides a robust observational foundation for assessing trends of dissolved oxygen variability, mainly associated with climate change, anomalies related to deoxygenation processes, and contributes to advancing our understanding of ventilation processes in the WMED. It also serves as a benchmark for calibrating Biogeochemical-Argo floats and for validating regional biogeochemical models. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.982858 (Belgacem et al., 2025).",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:05:02.095849
Holocene climate dynamics in the central Mediterranean inferred from pollen data,"Léa d'Oliveira, S. Joannin, G. Ménot, N. Combourieu-Nebout, L. Dugerdil, Marion Blache, M. Robles, A. Florenzano, A. Masi, A. Mercuri, L. Sadori, Marie Balasse, Odile Peyron",2025,2025-11-19,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fc4ce6b816fe28f773084750d40a0c8431775f3b,"Abstract. The Mediterranean climate is characterised by strong seasonality, which is critical for the ecosystems and societies in the region and makes them susceptible to climate change. The timing of when the Mediterranean climate developed over the past few thousand years remains a complex and unresolved question. Most studies document a part of the Mediterranean area or are based on a single (and frequently different) climate reconstruction method, which can lead to non-negligible biases when considering climate changes on a Mediterranean scale. Several climate summaries based on pollen data have recently been produced on a European scale. However, few of them have focused exclusively on the Mediterranean area, except for two recent syntheses documenting the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean basin. We aimed to document the climate changes in the central Mediterranean during the Holocene, including trends and different patterns. A robust methodology has been applied to 38 pollen records spreading across the south of France and Italy. Four climate reconstruction methods based on different mathematical and ecological concepts have been tested (MAT, WA-PLS, BRT and RF), and the selection of the best modern calibration dataset has also been investigated to produce the most reliable results. Particular attention has been paid to the seasonal nature of climatic parameters (winter and summer temperatures and precipitation). A model-data comparison has been made using the transient model simulation TraCE-21ka in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the climate mechanisms and their forcing. Our palaeoclimate reconstruction shows that during the mid Holocene, summer temperatures were slightly colder than modern-day conditions in the southern part of the central Mediterranean region, which is not completely in accordance with the summer temperature reconstructions of the Iberian Peninsula and eastern Mediterranean for the mid Holocene. In northern parts of the central Mediterranean region, and particularly in high elevation (> 1000 m), a Holocene thermal maximum is present, contrasting with the cold summer temperature anomalies previously reconstructed with pollen data for the Mediterranean region. Holocene summer conditions were characterised by specific spatio-temporal patterns, i.e., a west–east differentiation in southern France and a north–south one in Italy, for both temperature and precipitation. Holocene winter conditions showed a more homogeneous spatio-temporal pattern, i.e., general humidification and warming throughout the Holocene for Italy and southern France, which is coherent with the winter temperature reconstructions of the Iberian Peninsula and eastern Mediterranean. A data–model comparison shows a mostly coherent signal in winter but an incoherent one in summer. Those discrepancies between model simulations and pollen-based reconstructions suggest that during the Holocene, the northern Mediterranean climate was already subject to a marked spatio-temporal variability, particularly in summer, that cannot only be explained by changes in orbital configuration and atmospheric greenhouse gas evolution. Finally, our result highlighted the onset of the “Mediterraneanization” of the central Mediterranean region, characterised by wet winters and dry summers, after 8000 years Before Present (BP). The “Mediterraneanization” process seems to have had a greater impact on the southern regions than on the northern regions.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:05:02.095862
Water Discharge Peak Estimation Based on HEC‐HMS and Predicted Curve Numbers for Flood Forecast in the River Brembo (Northern Italy),"C. Giudicianni, Hossein Aghaee, Luca Ventura, E.

This methodology uses single‐event hydrological modeling based on the software HEC‐HMS and curve numbers (CNs) estimated as a function of antecedent and current weather variables and is applied to the river Brembo case study in Northern Italy. By using rainfall, weather, and water discharge data collected over an eleven‐year‐long period, from 2013 to 2023, HEC‐HMS is first used to optimize the CN values at two cross sections in the Brembo basin, in an attempt to reproduce the flood peak in numerous single rain events. Then, regression equations are constructed to express CN as a function of current event rainfall depth and antecedent rainfall depth and temperature, as explicative variables for current soil conditions. The good predictive performance of HEC‐HMS based on CN values estimated through the regression equations (for the peak flow at the two cross sections, a mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively, in calibration, and 0.33 and 0.45, respectively, in validation; and an index of agreement [d] of 0.84 and 0.92, respectively, in calibration, and 0.86 and 0.88, respectively, in validation) makes the modeling tool constructed in the paper efficient and effective for potential early‐warning applications.",,"peak flow estimation, river Brembo case, flow estimation, peak flow",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:07:08.558768
An impact-oriented framework for a deep learning–based composite drought index considering potential economic losses.,"Mostafa Khosh Chehreh, C. De michele",2025,2025-12-02,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de306b84510c69893d8e08a1462aaa977da8b329,"Droughts significantly impact socioeconomic systems globally. As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, drought is characterized through various indices - meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological- each capturing different aspects of the phenomenon. This diversity has led to growing demand for integrated drought monitoring tools that offer a more holistic understanding of drought conditions. Traditionally, newly developed composite drought indices are assessed through the comparison with existing indices. However, this model-by-model validation approach does not necessarily reflect real-world accuracy or relevance. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed – from comparative validation among indices to impact-oriented evaluation - emphasizing the capacity of drought indices to capture actual societal and environmental consequences. In this study, we propose a novel drought index derived from deep learning, evaluated through an impact-oriented lens using drought-induced economic losses as the primary performance metric. The index is computed using advanced deep learning techniques and a range of drought-related variables. To enhance model accuracy and robustness, we employ different self-supervised learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and variational autoencoders. The analysis utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data (1989–2024) for Italy, integrated with economic loss records from the EM-DAT database. Each model's performance is assessed based on its ability to estimate potential economic losses caused by drought. The proposed framework allows users to select the most suitable index based on a guided analysis, balancing data collection effort and predictive reliability.",,Droughts significantly impact,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:07:08.558972
Large Dam Flood Risk Scenario: A Multidisciplinary Approach Analysis for Reduction in Damage Effects,"L. Turconi, F. Luino, A. Roccati, Gilberto Zaina, Barbara Bono",2025,2025-10-11,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dacc562723ff71ccda6138499aacc0023f17d078,"Dam collapse is a catastrophic event involving an artificial reservoir usually filled with water for hydropower or irrigation purposes. Several cases of dam collapses have overwhelmed entire valleys, reconfiguring their geomorphology, redesigning their landscape, and causing several thousand casualties. These episodes led to more careful regulations and the activation of more effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. A fundamental tool in defining appropriate procedures for alert and risk scenarios is the Dam Emergency Plan (PED), an operational document that establishes the actions and procedures required to manage potential hazards (e.g., geo-hydrological and seismic risk). The aim of this study is to describe a reference methodology for identifying geo-hydrological criticalities based on historical and geomorphological data, applied to civil protection activities. A further objective is to provide a structured inventory of Italian reservoirs, assigning each a potential risk index based on an analytical approach considering several factors (age and construction methodology of the dam, morphological and environmental settings, anthropized environment, and exposed population). The approach identifies that the most significant change in risk over time is not only the dam itself but also the transformation of the territory. This methodology does not incorporate probabilistic forecasting of flood or climate change; instead, it objectively characterizes the exposed territory, offering insights into existing vulnerabilities on which to base effective mitigation strategies.",,"irrigation purposes, filled with water, water for hydropower",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T23:07:08.558994

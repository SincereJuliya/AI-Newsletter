"Isotopic Evidence from the Po River Under Prolonged Drought Conditions (Northern Italy, 2022–2023)","G. Bianchini, V. Brombin, C. Marchina, C. Natali",2025,2025-11-16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc1b92bd1a6a72cf3112fd32c1a396b4521df720,"The Po River, the largest watercourse in northern Italy, represents a fundamental resource for the socio-economic system of the Padanian Plain. Between February 2022 and February 2023, the basin was affected by exceptional climatic anomalies, with unprecedented high temperatures, marked precipitation deficits, and the most severe hydrological drought documented in the instrumental record. Po river waters sampled during this period showed variable increases (Na+, K+, Mg2+, HCO3−, Cl−, SO42−) or decreases (Ca2+, NO3−) in the geochemical composition of major ions compared to data from previous decades collected under various climatic and hydrological conditions In contrast, the water stable isotope composition (δ2H and δ18O) of the period 2022–2023 displayed distinct and peculiar signatures, ranging from −64.1 to −53.5‰ for δ2H and from −9.4 to −5.7‰ for δ18O, compared to historical averages for 1998–2014 (−71.3 to −58.0‰ and −10.0 to −8.7‰, respectively). These values indicate a strong enrichment in heavy isotopes, reflecting warmer and drier climatic conditions, comparable only to those observed during the severe drought of 2015. Two groups of data were identified: Group 1, showing affinities with Eastern Mediterranean precipitation, and Group 2, characterized by pronounced evaporative isotopic enrichment due to prolonged drought, as evidenced by strongly negative d-excess and LC-excess values, consistent with those from arid and semi-arid regions worldwide. This study demonstrates how climate change and increasing hydrological stress are altering the isotopic composition of one of Europe’s most important river systems. Stable isotopes provide a sensitive tool for tracing moisture sources, quantifying evaporative processes, and assessing drought impacts, confirming their role as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) in climate and water-resource studies.",Po,"largest watercourse, watercourse in northern",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T16:43:44.397271
More intense heatwaves under drier conditions: a compound event analysis in the Adige River basin (Eastern Italian Alps),"Marc Lemus-Canovas, Alice Crespi, Elena Maines, Stefano Terzi, Massimiliano Pittore",2025,2025-11-28,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c71bae8d01666e8b9a8a08e1cacf9615001d759,"Abstract. The Adige River basin has been affected several times in recent years by concurrent very hot and dry conditions. In summers 2015, 2017, and more recently in 2021–2022, severe hydrological droughts compounded and cascaded with wildfire and heatwave events. The chained effect of snow deficit in winter, higher-than-normal temperatures in early spring and heatwaves during summer caused multiple drought impacts. Despite the severe consequences, the role of observed climate change in exacerbating the intensity of the drivers leading to specific hot and dry events and their potential impacts in this region remains poorly understood. A ranking of compound drought and heatwave events (CDHW) occurring in the Adige River basin between 1950 and 2023 was built using E-OBS precipitation and temperature observations. The ranking was based on a composite index considering both event intensity and the spatial extent of the affected area, derived from the Standardised Precipitation Index at a 6 month scale (SPI-6) and a heatwave definition based on daily maximum temperature (TX). The major 2022 CDHW event, which caused severe environmental and societal impacts in the Adige River catchment, stood out. Occurring in late spring (10–28 May 2022), it ranked fifth out of 119 events detected since 1950 and was the most intense CDHW event in the past 15 years. As one of the most recent and severe CDHW events, the 2022 event was selected for an in-depth characterisation and a climate change attribution analysis of both its meteorological drivers and hydrological impacts. The changing characteristics of CDHW events similar to that of May 2022 were investigated through a flow-analogue attribution approach based on the reconstruction of its atmospheric conditions using ERA5 geopotential height at 500 hPa. By comparing May 2022 CDHW flow analogues from 1951–1980 (low anthropogenic forcing) and 1992–2021 (moderate-high anthropogenic forcing), we found that heatwaves comparable to the one in May 2022 are now significantly hotter – by 1–4 °C – than historical analogues and occur in a much drier context, characterised by pronounced precipitation deficits. These conditions, along with earlier snowmelt and persistent precipitation deficits, might have exacerbated river flow reductions and water stress in recent years. Also, shifts in the timing of a CDHW event were found to significantly influence the severity of its potential consequences. However, extracting a reliable signal of future changes in the characteristics of CDHW events from climate projections remains challenging. Based on flow-conditioned analogues of the May 2022 event from 25 EURO-CORDEX simulations, more than half of the models failed to reproduce the observed sign of change in temperature and drought conditions. Unconditioned reconstructions showed closer agreement with observations, particularly for temperature patterns, but critical aspects such as the magnitude of the changes remained underestimated.",Adige,"Adige River basin, Adige River",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T16:53:11.493005
Climate-Adaptive Irrigation Management in Venetian Reclamation Consortia (Italy),"Francesco Salmaso, A. Cogato, Lucia Bortolini",2025,2025-11-16,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad87467805282570e9c78f14f7665816966298db,"Climate change poses increasing challenges to Reclamation Consortia, which must ensure equitable and sustainable water distribution under conditions of growing scarcity. This study evaluates supplemental irrigation management strategies adopted by three Reclamation Consortia in the Venetian Plain (Northeast Italy): Piave, Veneto Orientale and Acque Risorgive. The Consortia were selected based on their territorial and structural characteristics, as well as their different approach to managing water resources. This study fills a critical gap by integrating FAO AquaCrop-based estimates of irrigation needs for the 2022 and 2023 irrigation seasons in maize, grapevine and radicchio with an institutional analysis of Reclamation Consortia, offering an innovative framework that links technical and governance aspects of sustainable water management. Results reveal considerable variability among Consortia in terms of organizational structure, technological adoption, and resilience to drought. The 2022 season, characterized by extreme drought, required substantially higher irrigation volumes across all crops and soil types with significant differences compared to 2023 (p < 0.001), particularly for maize and grapevine (73% more irrigation water in maize). Well-drained soils and sprinkler irrigated crops showed the highest water demand (+45 mm compared to drip irrigation, p = 0.058), while loamy soils and drip systems proved more efficient. The Piave Consortium demonstrated the most advanced management system, supported by digital tools and structured rotation schedules. Nevertheless, structural factors, such as geographic location and infrastructure capacity, play a critical role in shaping resilience, leading to higher vulnerability in Consortia like Veneto Orientale and robustness in Acque Risorgive during drought conditions (i.e., 2022). Overall, the findings highlight the need to strengthen the main pillars of adaptation in irrigated agriculture, i.e., technology (decision support systems), governance (inter-Consortium coordination), and infrastructure (storage facilities), to promote flexible irrigation planning, enhance adaptive capacity, and ensure long-term sustainability under changing climatic conditions. These strategies also contribute directly to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 2, 6, and 13 (Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, and Climate Action) by improving water use efficiency, securing crop production, and enhancing resilience to climate change.",,"sustainable water distribution, growing scarcity",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:02:40.656317
Biometric and molecular responses to water deficit in two contrasting Italian durum wheat cultivars,"Martino Schillaci, Mauro Centritto, E. Zampieri",2025,2025-10-08,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0bfb1db762c514714f0643111b81f701e0e372e4,"The impact of global warming on agriculture is widely recognized, and events of water scarcity are predicted to increase in the upcoming years. In our study, we examined the response of two Triticum turgidum spp. durum cultivars, Marco Aurelio (MA) and Antalis (AN), to water deficit stress, focusing on biometric traits and the expression of selected genes in their shoots and roots. During the first part of the water stress cycle that lasted 25 days, MA and AN reached soil water content (SWC) of 14 and 25%, respectively. The applied water stress had a significant impact on plant growth, adversely affecting several biometric traits. Notably, the two cultivars showed distinct responses to drought: AN maintained root biomass, whereas MA sustained similar shoot biomass through spike production. Despite these differences, total plant biomass of the two genotypes did not differ under water stress conditions, suggesting an improved water use efficiency in AN. Gene expression analyses indicated a broadly similar stress response in both cultivars, marked by the activation of genes involved in stress response, hormone metabolism and detoxification pathways. However, two genes associated with flowering regulation, IAA15 and NTL3A, were specifically up-regulated in the shoots of MA plants under stress, enabling these plants to flower under stress conditions. The study examined how two durum wheat cultivars respond to water deficit at both the phenotypic and gene expression levels. While both cultivars showed similar reductions in biomass, they differed in water use and flowering time under stress, traits that could be useful for improving yield in dry climates. Early flowering response, particularly in the Antalis cultivar, led to improved water use efficiency (WUE) and may help avoid stress during the reproductive stage, potentially boosting yields.",,water,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:02:40.656345
Guidance for Practitioners When Selecting Low-growing Shrubs for Challenging Urban Sites: A Systematic Literature Review of Information on Drought Tolerance and Ecosystem Services,"Giacomo Guzzon, and Norbert Kühn, Bernd Hertle, Henrik Sjöman",2025,2025-09-01,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a3e6c4061cae4b344ad4f7e171538cdb1249912f,"Urban sites are often characterized by limited space and harsh growing conditions, which present many challenges for plants. Shrubs constitute a significant proportion of the plant material used in urban plantings. Because of their variability in size, form, and habitat requirements, they are helpful design elements for the greening of cities. Therefore, it is incumbent on practitioners to have detailed information about the tolerance of shrubs to environmental stresses to inform their choices. The increasing prevalence of dry and unpredictable rainfall patterns further compounds these. The issue of water stress represents a significant constraint for plants in urban environments. Consequently, those responsible for selecting plants for such areas must consider drought tolerance when making their choices. The objectives of this study were to ascertain the current availability of information regarding drought tolerance and the provision of ecosystem services of selected shrub species and to evaluate the extent to which this information provides guidance to practitioners. To achieve this, books, nursery catalogues, and academic articles were subjected to a review process. A total of 10 European nurseries were consulted to select five common and five uncommon low-growing shrub species for the subsequent literature screening. The species-specific information was extracted by considering findings concerning the tolerance to environmental stresses, the provision of ecosystem services, the recommendations for use in urban environments, and the natural habitat of the species. The findings indicated that extant information was available for most species. However, this information was frequently generic, contradictory, concerned with botanical characteristics rather than site-related information, or excessively focused on a singular stress factor in a controlled setting, thereby limiting its utility for practitioners. The knowledge documented in books is predominantly unsubstantiated and based on the author’s experiences and qualitative observations. These findings underscore the necessity for reliable quantitative assessments of stress tolerance in numerous widely used shrub species to inform professionals’ plant selections for urban environments and ecosystem services.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:02:40.656353
Arctic Soil C and N Cycling Are Linked With Microbial Adaptations During Drought,"Theis Thomsen, M. D. Schostag, Anders Priemé, Jonathan Donhauser",2025,2025-09-01,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2ab73f9097f00ad2c7011c633dac09781018e625,"Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of drought events, yet the mechanisms of microbe‐mediated soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling under drought are poorly understood. We conducted a microcosm experiment with a Greenlandic soil subjected to five levels of drought, reducing water content from 180% to 15% over the course of 3 weeks followed by rewetting, mimicking a natural drought event. We linked changes in microbial gene expression related to stress response as well as C and N cycling with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, extracellular enzyme activities, and soil C and N status. Maximum changes in gene expression occurred at intermediate levels of drought (80% water content), characterized by acclimation of microbial physiology to drought conditions, including production of osmolytes as well as cell wall and membrane modifications. This peak in gene expression changes marked a tipping point associated with a pronounced decline in microbial respiration as well as extracellular enzyme activities under more intense drought conditions. Interestingly, C‐cycling gene expression correlated with soil dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, NO3− and PO43− contents. Moreover, N‐cycling gene expression correlated with PO43− contents and with the activity of laccases. These findings highlight linkages between microbial C, N, and P cycling because of stoichiometric constraints under drought. 24 h after rewetting, we found a shift in microbial expression of C usage genes towards more labile compounds, and an increase in genes related to anabolic activity and signaling, but no signatures of stress responses, suggesting that the microbial community had overcome rewetting‐induced changes in osmotic pressure and allocated metabolic activity to growth. Overall, we show that microbial physiological drought responses and microbial resource usage related to C:N:P stoichiometry are key mechanisms of C and N cycling in the Arctic soil under drying and rewetting.",,drought,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:02:40.656362
Sediment Assessment Using Coupled RUSLE-SDR Models of Future Mellegue2 Dam in Tunisia,"Sahar Abidi, Hammadi Achour, Fida Mouelhi, Omrana Aıdara, Mahnaz Gümrükçüoğlu Yiğit, Lamia Lajili Ghezal",2025,2025-12-06,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9acd8a32691c28c4a3b186aac695d6d14f198da,"Over the last 60 years, Mellegue1 Dam has lost approximately 80% of its original 268 million cubic meter capacity to siltation, reflecting broader Mediterranean basin patterns in which climate-driven erosion has exacerbated dam sedimentation rates. In response, the strategic building of the upstream Mellegue2 Dam is intended to address water scarcity, improve flood management, and ensure a continuous supply of water for agricultural and domestic purposes. This study fills critical knowledge gaps by integrating climate change projections with sediment modeling in Mediterranean semi-arid environments, developing spatially explicit conservation strategies using combined RUSLE-SDR and SWAT modeling, and evaluating management interventions under future scenarios using drought-flush erosion mechanisms documented across the Mediterranean basin. This study evaluates sediment dynamics in the Mellegue2 Dam watershed from 1993 to 2019 using an integrated RUSLE-IC-SDR modelling approach, with model validation performed using a three-tiered framework that included SWAT comparison, historical sedimentation records, and regional correlation analysis. The model performed well (NSE=0.78, R²=0.82), with an average annual prediction error of 12.3%, similar to verified Mediterranean erosion models. Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations, accounting for parameter variability in R-factor (±15%), K-factor (±20%), and C-factor (±25%), yielded confidence intervals of -18% to +22% for annual forecasts. The temporal study demonstrates drought-flush erosion mechanisms common to Mediterranean climates, with post-drought sediment outputs increasing by 40-60% above normal years, consistent with regional research from Spain, Italy, and Greece. According to the management scenario study, Mellegue2 Dam will lose 50% of its capacity within 24 years if no intervention is implemented. However, comprehensive watershed management based on proven Mediterranean basin conservation practices has the potential to increase operational lifespan to 75 years while also delivering broader environmental benefits. The study finds three priority management zones that require distinct conservation approaches, with the largest return on investment found on northwestern slopes with erosion rates of more than 12 t/ha/year. These findings contribute to better knowledge of climate-driven erosion processes across the Mediterranean and offer management solutions that can be applied to similar semi-arid watersheds.",,"Mediterranean basin patterns, Mediterranean basin",Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:02:40.656369
Addressing climate-induced aridity in vineyards through a data-driven approach based on open-access EO: the case study of Negramaro in the Puglia region,"A. Capolupo, E.

However, the impacts of climate change, such as rising temperatures, lower rainfall, and more frequent extreme weather events, are increasing aridity in traditional wine-producing areas. These changes threaten the long-term sustainability of vineyards by reducing grape yield and quality. This study introduces a data-based approach to assess and map water stress in vineyard landscapes, using freely available satellite data from European and American space programs. The method combines several environmental indicators that reflect drought and plant stress, including land surface temperature, changes in vegetation health, rainfall shortages, and soil water availability. These variables are analyzed using a statistical technique that reduces complexity and highlights dominant patterns of stress across space. The approach was applied to the Negramaro wine district in Brindisi, in southern Italy, an area highly exposed to water scarcity. The analysis produced vulnerability maps that identify zones most at risk, supporting precise and adaptive vineyard management strategies. These include optimized irrigation, better canopy management, and soil conservation measures. This method also supports broader planning efforts, such as climate-smart farming policies, remote sensing-based insurance schemes, and environmental subsidy targeting. The study shows that satellite data and statistical tools can guide practical solutions to climate challenges in agriculture.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:02:40.656375
Tree size inequality as a driver of growth dominance across climatic gradients in managed silver fir forests in Europe,"Bohdan Kolisnyk, Shamim Ahmed, Camilla Wellstein, E.

While growth dominance and tree size inequality are widely used to describe competitive interactions, their relationship remains poorly understood in managed forests. This study examines the links between growth dominance, tree size inequality, stocking density, and climatic conditions in silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) dominated stands. Using data from circular 109 plots established across four sites in Germany, Italy, and Poland, and incre­ment cores from 386 silver fir and 77 European beech trees, we fitted generalized additive models (GAM) to reconstruct individual tree growth and a piecewise structural equation model (SEM) to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of stand structure and climate aridity on growth dominance. The fitted GAMs showed moderate to high explanatory power (adjusted R² = 0.48–0.77). The SEM ex­plained a substantial proportion of variance in growth dominance (marginal R² = 0.57). Growth dominance increased strongly with tree size inequality (standardized estimate = 0.635), while climate aridity reduced it directly (–0.321) and indirectly through negative effects on tree size inequality (–0.324) and stocking density (–0.404). The total effect of climate aridity on growth dominance was substantial (–0.472). These findings demonstrate that growth dominance is an emergent property shaped by resource competi­tion, disturbance, and management legacies. Recognizing this is crucial for forest science and management, as it helps disentangle competition modes and highlights the need to integrate stand structure and com­petitive dynamics into silvicultural planning to sustain the stability and productivity of silver fir dominated stands.",,key driver,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:05:49.628335

S. europaea was also cultivated under non-saline conditions. Results showed differences in mineral content, and bioactive compounds among genotypes, but they were modulated by environmental conditions, leading to significant site-specific variation. S. europaea, regardless of the collecting sites, exhibited the highest concentration of minerals (K, Ca, and Mg), chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds as well as antioxidant activity. A. macrostachyum stood out for its high flavonoid and sterol content, exhibiting other nutritional traits comparable to S. europaea when collected in a more arid site.

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) delivers a wide range of free and open products in relation to atmospheric composition at global and regional scales. The CAMS Regional Service produces daily forecasts, analyses, and reanalyses of air quality in Europe. This service relies on a distributed modelling production by 11 teams in 10 European countries: CHIMERE (France), DEHM (Denmark), EMEP (Norway), EURAD-IM (Germany), GEM-AQ (Poland), LOTOS-EUROS (the Netherlands), MATCH (Sweden), MINNI (Italy), MOCAGE (France), MONARCH (Spain), and SILAM (Finland). The project management and coordination of the service is conducted by a Centralised Regional Production Unit. Every day, each model produces 24 h analyses for the previous day and 97 h forecasts for 19 chemical species over a spatial domain at 0.1 × 0.1° resolution (approximately 10 km × 10 km), with 420 points in latitude and 700 in longitude and 10 vertical levels. Six pollen species are also delivered for the surface forecasts. The 11 individual models are then combined into an ENSEMBLE median.

Stem water potential (Ψ-stem) is a reliable parameter of plant water status in several fruit orchards, including olive trees. However, traditional in situ measurements of Ψ-stem are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and destructive, allowing only limited samples and repetitions. Remote sensing technologies could be a promising alternative to conventional methods for estimating Ψ-stem. In this study, we conducted field measurements of midday Ψ-stem in an irrigated olive orchard located in southern Italy during the 2024 growing season, between June and October. Multispectral remotely sensed reflectance data were also collected simultaneously with the time of Ψ-stem in-situ measurements, acquired by Next-Generation PlanetScope, a new generation of spatial and time high-resolution satellites. Successively, 37 vegetation indices (VI) were computed from the PlanetScope images, and they were tested as proxies for Ψ-stem. A Random Forest (RF) model was used to perform multivariable regression, providing an accurate prediction of olive water status. The correlation coefficient between in-situ measured Ψ-stem and predicted Ψ-stem of the RF model is equal to R2 = 0.91 in training and R2 = 0.73 in test.

The meta‐analysis allowed a comprehensive diagnosis of CIAs operating in four countries (Italy, Malaysia, Spain and Turkey). The good performance of the CIAs was clearly associated with the following factors: satisfactory coverage of irrigation services, water delivery efficiency, financial self‐sufficiency, capacity of fee collection and economic production. These factors included responses to smaller command areas, the prevalence of on‐demand water distribution methods and water‐conveying systems in pressured pipelines, and the significant presence of farm drip systems. In contrast, the poorly performing CIAs presented poor irrigation service coverage and an excessive water supply to crops and personnel staff.

In this work, we present a SPICE model for a 4H-SiC BJT and TTL inverter exposed to gamma radiation. The devices were fabricated using a dedicated SiC bipolar process at KTH (Sweden) and tested at the 60Co Calliope (Italy) facility up to 800 krad (Si). Experimental data, including Gummel plots and inverter transfer characteristics, were used to calibrate and refine a VBIC-based SPICE model. The adjusted model accounts for both bulk and surface degradation mechanisms by extracting parameters of forward current gain (βF), saturation current (IS), base resistance (RB), and forward transit time (TF). Results show a uniform degradation of BJTs, primarily manifested as reduced current gain and increased base resistance, while the inverter maintained functional operation up to 600 krad(Si). Extrapolation of the SPICE model predicts a failure threshold near 16 Mrad(Si), far exceeding the tolerance of conventional silicon circuits. By linking radiation-induced defects at the material and interface levels to circuit-level behavior, the proposed model enables realistic design and lifetime prediction of SiC integrated circuits for satellites, planetary missions, and other radiation-intensive applications.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:06:53.490168

Hence, both agricultural practices and natural regeneration in these areas are hindered by poor plant establishment and growth. The use of plant growth-promoting (PGP) microorganisms has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance plant performance under these harsh conditions. Methods In this context, the aim of this work was to isolate and screen the PGP properties of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria from biocrusts in arid soils, representing a highly unexplored niche of microorganisms with potential application in agriculture and ecological restoration. We determined key PGP traits, including phosphate and potassium solubilization, growth under nitrogen-free conditions, siderophore and auxin production, as well as protease, lipase, DNase, amylase, catalase, and cytochrome-C-oxidase activities. Results Our results showed that, among the cyanobacteria analyzed, Nostoc commune CANT2, isolated from the province of Almería (Spain), exhibited the highest number of PGP properties, followed by N. commune AB55 (southern Sardinia, Italy) and Trichocoleus cf. desertorum CAU7 (Almería). Both strains AB55 and CANT2 are characterized by their production of exopolysaccharides (EPS). Regarding the heterotrophic bacterial strains, those with the best PGP properties were identified as Peribacillus frigoritolerans and Bacillus atrophaeus by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Seed biopriming experiments with the model plant Triticum aestivum showed that application of N. commune CANT2, either alone or in combination with P. frigoritolerans 1E, enhanced vigor indices by up to 58% compared to the control. Discussion These findings highlight the potential of combined microbial consortia with PGP activities as candidates for the development of biostimulants, offering a sustainable approach to improve plant growth and resilience in dryland agriculture.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:06:53.490219

Willd. to adapt to diverse habitats reflects its remarkable ecological plasticity. This study investigates the morphological and anatomical traits of D. aegyptium across six distinct habitat types in semi-arid regions, which vary in moisture availability, soil texture, and levels of disturbance. We used one-way ANOVA and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to evaluate habitat-driven differences and identify key patterns of trait variation. We found significant habitat-induced differences in morphological traits such as stem length, root length, leaf length, and plant biomass. Stem length and diameter peaked in sandy and canal bank habitats, while abandoned land exhibited the lowest values. Leaf length was highest in canal bank habitats and lowest in abandoned land. Sandy places supported the highest biomass, reflecting optimal growth conditions, while abandoned land recorded minimal biomass. Anatomical traits displayed habitat-specific adaptations, with roadside habitats exhibiting the thickest root epidermis and sandy places showing the highest endodermis thickness. Leaf anatomical features such as vascular bundle dimensions and bulliform cell density varied significantly, reflecting adaptations to environmental stresses. PCA revealed that plant traits clustered according to habitat type, with traits such as stem length, leaf size, and biomass associated with resource-rich habitats like roadside and agricultural land, indicating habitat-driven differentiation and adaptive plasticity. These findings highlight the strong relationship between habitat variability and morphological and anatomical plasticity in D. aegyptium, providing insights into its adaptive strategies in semi-arid regions. This study contributes to understanding the ecological resilience of grass species under varying environmental conditions and highlights the importance of habitat-driven plasticity in shaping plant traits.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:06:53.490226

In this study, surface mass balance (SMB) is estimated from snow accumulation data collected in the nearby area of Concordia Station, Antarctica. Results from the Italian and French stake farms are jointly analysed. The Italian stake farm consists of 13 stakes; continuous observations started at the end of 2010 with near-monthly sampling. Some measurements are also available for the 2006–2010 period from a previous stake farm. The French stake farm consists of 50 stakes; observations started in 2004 with yearly sampling during austral summer. Snow buildup measurements at individual stakes show a strong variability caused by the interaction of wind-driven snow with surface micro-relief. In the common observation period, the present Italian stake farm generally underestimates the SMB with respect to the French one, except for 3 years in which an overestimation is observed. Over the 2011–2023 period, the mean yearly accumulation recorded by the Italian and French stake farms is 7.3 ± 0.2 cm and 8.4 ± 0.1 cm, respectively. Bootstrap simulation has been performed to: (i) assess the significance of the differences between the two datasets; (ii) evaluate the effect on the measurements of the different size of the stake farms and their distance to the Station. The comparison of the observations with reanalysis datasets (ERA5 and MERRA2) and regional models (RACMO2.4p1, MAR3.12) indicates the former more in agreement with the observations. The potential interaction effect of the Station has also been investigated by analysing wind direction during snowfall events, suggesting that buildings may influence accumulation. In fact, in the hyper-arid environment of Dome C, snow accumulation is largely governed by post-depositional processes such as wind redistribution and clear-sky precipitation. Buildings alter the wind field, enhancing erosion beneath them and forming snowdrifts leeward and laterally, which may explain accumulation differences between the ITA and FRA stake fields. Additionally, two more stake farms, located 25 km North and South of Concordia Station, are also analysed to study the SMB gradient across Dome C, confirming previous results. On average, yearly SMB increases northward by 8 %–9 % over the 50 km span between the southern and northern stake farms. At Concordia, for the 2004–2023 period, a mean SMB of 27.21 ± 0.60 kg m−2 has been estimated, taking into account the uncertainty of the observations and of the snow compaction effect. Results are valuable for validating SMB estimated from reanalysis, regional climate models and remote-sensing data.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:06:53.490234

The research quantifies the temperature variations in the shallow subsurface over the past 150 years (1875-2025), calibrating the model against groundwater temperature measurements, and predicts trends up to 2100. Current estimates indicate urban temperature anomalies up to +5°C at the water table depth, and an expansion of the SUHI along the two-dimensional cross-section from 3 km in 1884 to 9 km in 2025. The findings highlight the heterogeneous distribution of subsurface temperature anomalies, influenced by variations in the groundwater depth, flow patterns, land cover and urban and infrastructure expansion. Future projections suggest a further increase in subsurface temperatures, particularly in areas with shallow groundwater.

The combined or individual action of certain climatic and environmental factors can lead to oak decline in various oak forest types. A study was conducted between 2015 and 2022 in southern Italy, encompassing thirty oak forest stands dominated by various Quercus species, including Q. cerris, Q. frainetto, Q. ilex, Q. pubescens, and affected by oak decline. The study employed field sampling, NDVI data, and remote sensing techniques. The distribution of the forest stands encompassed both the Temperate and Mediterranean bioclimatic regions. A total of 18 quantitative and 4 qualitative variables were recorded and subsequently compared with a damage severity scale based on field observations. The values of the variables were analyzed using both descriptive and multivariate statistics to ascertain their role in triggering oak decline episodes. It was found that eight variables were the most significant in explaining the occurrence of oak decline. These were the first-semester average rainfall (PL), average maximum summer temperature, Rainfall anomaly index, Downward shortwave radiation, Root zone soil moisture, and three indicators concerning the number, amplitude, and duration of heatwaves. Quercus pubescens forests were found to be the most affected by oak decline. The years 2017 and 2022 were characterized by high levels of stress, with the combined effect of groups of diagnostic variables in exceeding the critical thresholds proving decisive in triggering episodes of oak decline. A vulnerability map was finally created reporting three vulnerability classes for oak decline: low, medium, and high.

Among all components, sea level is most strongly correlated with the composite index, underscoring Italy’s vulnerability to marine-related risks. Comparative analysis with European indices confirms both the robustness and specificity of the Italian exposure profile, reinforcing the need for tailored risk metrics.

This study explores the relationship between total cloud cover (TCC), solar forcing, and mean annual temperature variability in the Mediterranean region, focusing on both the pre‐industrial and the modern era (1982–2022). Leveraging 41 years of contemporary cloud data from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites and historical records from Italy's Benevento Observatory (dating back to 1870), we identify a marked decline in annual TCC across both periods, coupled with rising mean temperatures. Regional analyses highlight substantial disparities in TCC reductions, with declines of up to 10% per decade in Sicily (Italy) and northern Tunisia. A pivotal change‐point in cloud dynamics emerges around 2001, marked by a transition in the relationship between galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and TCC from consistent positive correlations (1982–2001) to spatially varied patterns thereafter. This shift coincides with a notable reduction in high‐cloud coverage (HCC) over the central and eastern Mediterranean. While causality remains uncertain, correlations point to GCRs and North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (NA‐THC) anomalies as potential modulators of regional cloud dynamics. Contrasting pre‐industrial (r = 0.46) and modern (r = −0.69) correlations underscore the complexity of cloud cover responses, highlighting the role of atmospheric circulation and the need for further investigation into these dynamics and their implications for climate variability.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:16:23.462973

Surface temperature was derived using a single-channel algorithm applied to thermal infrared data, with atmospheric correction and emissivity estimation based on vegetation indices. Monthly and seasonal composites were generated to capture both annual trends and seasonal fluctuations. Findings reveal a consistent increase in surface temperature during the growing season, especially between June and August. The years 2022 and 2023 showed extreme heat events, with temperatures exceeding the 90th percentile. Variability within the vineyard suggests that topography, canopy cover, and management practices influence local thermal dynamics. Compared to the surrounding land, the vineyard exhibited a cooler and more stable thermal signature, indicating its potential role as a microclimatic buffer.

The Mediterranean Sea is experiencing rapid environmental changes, underscoring the urgent need for high-quality, long-term datasets to quantify trends and assess impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Over the past few years, a lot of work has been done to improve and ensure data quality in the western Mediterranean Sea (WMED), but reliable dissolved oxygen (O2) data remain scarce. This is a critical gap as oxygen is a key indicator of marine ecosystem health and plays a central role in carbon and nutrient cycling. To address this gap, we compiled and rigorously quality-controlled a new regional-scale WMED dataset of O2 data from sensors mounted on conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) probes: CTD-O2WMED. This product includes over 1000 previously unpublished high-resolution vertical profiles of CTD-O2 measurements mostly collected within Italian cruises between 2004 and 2023.

Combined, this ensures the consistency of the final corrected CTD-O2WMED across both space and time.

The Mediterranean climate is characterised by strong seasonality, which is critical for the ecosystems and societies in the region and makes them susceptible to climate change. The timing of when the Mediterranean climate developed over the past few thousand years remains a complex and unresolved question. Most studies document a part of the Mediterranean area or are based on a single (and frequently different) climate reconstruction method, which can lead to non-negligible biases when considering climate changes on a Mediterranean scale. Several climate summaries based on pollen data have recently been produced on a European scale. However, few of them have focused exclusively on the Mediterranean area, except for two recent syntheses documenting the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean basin. We aimed to document the climate changes in the central Mediterranean during the Holocene, including trends and different patterns. A robust methodology has been applied to 38 pollen records spreading across the south of France and Italy. Four climate reconstruction methods based on different mathematical and ecological concepts have been tested (MAT, WA-PLS, BRT and RF), and the selection of the best modern calibration dataset has also been investigated to produce the most reliable results. Particular attention has been paid to the seasonal nature of climatic parameters (winter and summer temperatures and precipitation). A model-data comparison has been made using the transient model simulation TraCE-21ka in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the climate mechanisms and their forcing. Our palaeoclimate reconstruction shows that during the mid Holocene, summer temperatures were slightly colder than modern-day conditions in the southern part of the central Mediterranean region, which is not completely in accordance with the summer temperature reconstructions of the Iberian Peninsula and eastern Mediterranean for the mid Holocene. In northern parts of the central Mediterranean region, and particularly in high elevation (> 1000 m), a Holocene thermal maximum is present, contrasting with the cold summer temperature anomalies previously reconstructed with pollen data for the Mediterranean region. Holocene summer conditions were characterised by specific spatio-temporal patterns, i.e., a west–east differentiation in southern France and a north–south one in Italy, for both temperature and precipitation. Holocene winter conditions showed a more homogeneous spatio-temporal pattern, i.e., general humidification and warming throughout the Holocene for Italy and southern France, which is coherent with the winter temperature reconstructions of the Iberian Peninsula and eastern Mediterranean. A data–model comparison shows a mostly coherent signal in winter but an incoherent one in summer. Those discrepancies between model simulations and pollen-based reconstructions suggest that during the Holocene, the northern Mediterranean climate was already subject to a marked spatio-temporal variability, particularly in summer, that cannot only be explained by changes in orbital configuration and atmospheric greenhouse gas evolution. Finally, our result highlighted the onset of the “Mediterraneanization” of the central Mediterranean region, characterised by wet winters and dry summers, after 8000 years Before Present (BP). The “Mediterraneanization” process seems to have had a greater impact on the southern regions than on the northern regions.",,,Semantic Scholar,2025-12-10T17:16:23.463119

As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, drought is characterized through various indices - meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological- each capturing different aspects of the phenomenon. This diversity has led to growing demand for integrated drought monitoring tools that offer a more holistic understanding of drought conditions. Traditionally, newly developed composite drought indices are assessed through the comparison with existing indices. However, this model-by-model validation approach does not necessarily reflect real-world accuracy or relevance. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed – from comparative validation among indices to impact-oriented evaluation - emphasizing the capacity of drought indices to capture actual societal and environmental consequences. In this study, we propose a novel drought index derived from deep learning, evaluated through an impact-oriented lens using drought-induced economic losses as the primary performance metric. The index is computed using advanced deep learning techniques and a range of drought-related variables. To enhance model accuracy and robustness, we employ different self-supervised learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and variational autoencoders. The analysis utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data (1989–2024) for Italy, integrated with economic loss records from the EM-DAT database.

Po,"[Isotopic Evidence from the Po River Under Prolonged Drought Conditions (Northern Italy, 2022–2023)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc1b92bd1a6a72cf3112fd32c1a396b4521df720)
The study reveals distinct isotopic signatures in Po River waters during the 2022-2023 drought, characterized by enrichment in heavy isotopes and strong evaporative processes. This research highlights the sensitivity of stable isotopes to climate change and hydrological stress, providing valuable insights for monitoring and understanding drought impacts on European river systems.","largest watercourse, watercourse in northern"
Adige,"[More intense heatwaves under drier conditions: a compound event analysis in the Adige River basin (Eastern Italian Alps)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9c71bae8d01666e8b9a8a08e1cacf9615001d759)
The study analyzes the 2022 heatwave and drought event in the Adige River basin, ranking it as one of the most intense compound events since 1950. The analysis reveals that heatwaves are now significantly hotter (by 1-4°C) than historical analogues and occur in a much drier context, with pronounced precipitation deficits exacerbating river flow reductions and water stress.","Adige River basin, Adige River"
Others,"Recent studies in the Mediterranean basin reveal that droughts significantly impact regional patterns, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable water distribution. Researchers found that collective irrigation agencies are crucial in managing coupled fluid-flow and heat-transport dynamics to mitigate the effects of increasing droughts on plant water status. As the region faces growing scarcity, these findings underscore the importance of efficient irrigation purposes, such as filling reservoirs with water for hydropower generation, to ensure a key driver of sustainable development remains viable.","Droughts significantly impact;Mediterranean basin patterns, Mediterranean basin;collective irrigation agencies;coupled fluid-flow, fluid-flow and heat-transport;drought;increasing droughts;irrigation purposes, filled with water, water for hydropower;key driver;plant water status, water status, plant water;sustainable water distribution, growing scarcity;water"
